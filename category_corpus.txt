Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
Yes! Tomorrow night! 😊
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.
feeling good on a wednesday
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED

I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack.
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run.
Did they get the Bee?
Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again
Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!!
Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day?
Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today....
every time they say bee it duplicates the video
Does Randy have great temples?
Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now?
I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes.....
Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny.
😊Watch my YouTube videos😊
Why is this trending?
I'll get it LMAO
Stupid Trump supporters.😂😂😂
THEY DERK ER DERBS!!!
THE TOOK UER JEEEb!!
DEY TOOK AR JABS!!
Orgasmoooooooooooooos
Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit
I member ☺
I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011
What seems to be the officer, problem?
I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it
Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class).
Awesome.
Chief, no!
They took dur durrr
amazing work!
DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS
Can't wait!
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees
Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better
Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct?
Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump.
trump commits suicide after south park premiere
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates.
Trumptards
That reference though lol
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
(((South Park)))
LMAO WHITE TRASH
R.I.P. South Park.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Learn the truth about Charlottesville.
I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD
The Alt Right is the future!
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
It's started
Derk a Derrrr
dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
Day tooker jabbsss
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!

Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere

Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air

Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Or, how about a Stan/Wendy storyline, when he accidentally gets her pregnant.
R.I.P. South Park.
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\n\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\n\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\n\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\n\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\n\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\n\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\n\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\n\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\n\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\n\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.
Hey Alexa\n\n\n\n\nYEW WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!
One town, one relation! Death to mechanization!
🐸💥🔫 Alt right gotta take this L
I was disappointed. Im going to watch it again, to seal my disappointment with the episode, im going to add a layer of philosophy to it witch i probably didn't see amd isn't really their to digest it differently in hopes to find humorous meaning that may not really be there. </3 They should've either stopped at season 17 or stopped making them run together like a bigger longer cut.\n\ntl;dr this episode was disappointing.
Lol I love all the references to HGTV, especially Fixer Upper. xD\nI don't think lots of people really got it in the comments.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!

You have to watch this episode with your Alexa and laugh your ass off like I did...It's hilarious!!!!!
Alexa add titty chips to my shopping list LOL
So uh, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I've been glued to this show for (amazingly) 21 years now and this was the only episode I've ever seen that had nothing funny in it. Maybe Jim Bob, but that's fucking it.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D

Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo

DER TERK ER JERB
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
DEDER JEBS
South park makes fun of how stupid humanity is. Which means most of the people who like south park are the ones getting made fun of. So why do y'all like it if y'all see haw retarded it makes y'all look.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
feeling good on a wednesday
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Day tooker jabbsss
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
The creators are chickenshit. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this reverse racism bullshit. But, these two won't touch Muhammad, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
DurkEee DURRRR\nTUKRrr JaRBSS
This episode was so weak.
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
horrible horrible horrible episode.\nwow South Park wtf.\nwtf. wtf. wtf. wtf. why why why are you making your show shit now. it used to be great and now it sucks balls with this first episode. this is the best you could come up with??!? \nwowwww woww oowwowoeifjdjhdkfjsmfidnekdfucksouthparknowwtf
political randy episode\nsigh
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
(S)ALT RIGHT
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
shit episode
*CUCKED*\n*U*\n*C*\n*K*\n*E*\n*D*
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
Why won't they bring back chef...there are so many people that can do that voice spot on, just hire one
Alt-right nazis tears tastes so good...hmmm
R.I.P. South Park.
Idk this episode wasnt that funny.
Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air
Waited, watched and now disappointed.. South Park is dying.. Worst episode ever.
Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
Yes! Tomorrow night! 😊
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.
feeling good on a wednesday
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park

Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack.
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run.
Did they get the Bee?
Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again
Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!!
Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day?
Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today....
every time they say bee it duplicates the video
Does Randy have great temples?
Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now?
I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes.....
Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny.
😊Watch my YouTube videos😊
Why is this trending?
I'll get it LMAO
Stupid Trump supporters.😂😂😂
THEY DERK ER DERBS!!!
THE TOOK UER JEEEb!!
DEY TOOK AR JABS!!
Orgasmoooooooooooooos
Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit
I member ☺
I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011
What seems to be the officer, problem?
I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it
Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class).
Awesome.
Chief, no!
They took dur durrr
amazing work!
DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS
Can't wait!
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees
Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better
Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct?
Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump.
trump commits suicide after south park premiere
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates.
Trumptards
That reference though lol
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
(((South Park)))
LMAO WHITE TRASH
R.I.P. South Park.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Learn the truth about Charlottesville.
I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD
The Alt Right is the future!
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!

After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\n\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\n\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\n\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\n\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\n\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\n\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\n\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\n\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\n\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\n\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.
Hey Alexa\n\n\n\n\nYEW WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!
One town, one relation! Death to mechanization!
🐸💥🔫 Alt right gotta take this L
I was disappointed. Im going to watch it again, to seal my disappointment with the episode, im going to add a layer of philosophy to it witch i probably didn't see amd isn't really their to digest it differently in hopes to find humorous meaning that may not really be there. </3 They should've either stopped at season 17 or stopped making them run together like a bigger longer cut.\n\ntl;dr this episode was disappointing.
Lol I love all the references to HGTV, especially Fixer Upper. xD\nI don't think lots of people really got it in the comments.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!
this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT!
Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere
Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
You have to watch this episode with your Alexa and laugh your ass off like I did...It's hilarious!!!!!
Alexa add titty chips to my shopping list LOL
So uh, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I've been glued to this show for (amazingly) 21 years now and this was the only episode I've ever seen that had nothing funny in it. Maybe Jim Bob, but that's fucking it.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
This show is hilarious
(((South Park)))
It's started
Derk a Derrrr
dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb
Perfect
THEY TOOK OUR JOBS!
yeah bees in winter
TEY TOOK UR JEEEWBSSS
DEY TUK ER JERBS!!!!!!!!
I l southpar
OHH MYY FUUUCKING GOD ITS BACK! <3
YEAH TIP ASSIST
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
YES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASURE. THANK YOU MAT TREY
HAHAHAHA
nice 2 second clip guys.
Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!
DER TERK ER JERB
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
DEDER JEBS
South park makes fun of how stupid humanity is. Which means most of the people who like south park are the ones getting made fun of. So why do y'all like it if y'all see haw retarded it makes y'all look.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
feeling good on a wednesday
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Day tooker jabbsss
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
The creators are chickenshit. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this reverse racism bullshit. But, these two won't touch Muhammad, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
DurkEee DURRRR\nTUKRrr JaRBSS
This episode was so weak.
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
horrible horrible horrible episode.\nwow South Park wtf.\nwtf. wtf. wtf. wtf. why why why are you making your show shit now. it used to be great and now it sucks balls with this first episode. this is the best you could come up with??!? \nwowwww woww oowwowoeifjdjhdkfjsmfidnekdfucksouthparknowwtf
political randy episode\nsigh
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
(S)ALT RIGHT
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
shit episode
*CUCKED*\n*U*\n*C*\n*K*\n*E*\n*D*
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
Why won't they bring back chef...there are so many people that can do that voice spot on, just hire one
Alt-right nazis tears tastes so good...hmmm
R.I.P. South Park.
Idk this episode wasnt that funny.
Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air
Waited, watched and now disappointed.. South Park is dying.. Worst episode ever.
Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! No fucking way... How?! I mean... HOW?!
If Bethesda wants to gain popularity from nintendo fans...\n\n\n\n\n....they're succeeding.
This is massive.\n\nBethesda putting other 3rd parties on notice! Lol
And Bethesda again shows itself to be better than E.A
Wow Nintendo nice call
I have the weirdest Boner right now
Hell yeah, thank you id software and Nintendo.
Bethesda is one of the best allies helping   the Switch if other game developer give it more of a chance Switch will be way more successful. (Now here come the hate comments).
Holy shit, this is big, this is fucking Huge!!!
first time i saw this in direct\n\n\nme:WAIT WHAT
Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.
haill to bethesda now wee need fallout 4
Amazing move from Nintendo!!!!
Never expected this
Can we collect amiibos instead of the pop vinyls in doom for the switch?
Vulkan API Boyz!!!!
Fuck playing Doom and Wolfenstein on the go will be so sick
I guess Doom CAN run on anything...huh..
Where did this boner come from
My PC can max out these games but I want the portability, so I'll be buying them for Switch.
Now we're talking!
Did they hire that guy from Polygon to play this build too?
Fucking Doom wasn't expecting that, will buy
Now if only we could get Deus Ex Human Revolution on this thing. Don't feel like getting a Wii U to play that version of the game.\nEDIT: NVM, I take it back, I just remembered the Switch doesn't have Dual Screen functionality.
Switch underpowered umm nope...
The haters are going rage hater mode with this
look like it's time to kill demons and Nazi on the go!!!
Wait, what?
and fifa switch is a fifa 18 ps3 port...
Kinda bummed that the Switch version of Doom won't be getting Snapmap. I'm probably one of those weirdos who really loved the idea of map building on the go.
If we get the next elder scrolls for switch, I would fucking bend the knee to Bethesda
Instead of porting old good games, nintendo is going to burn it self with new games that would barely run on it.\nIf Switch could run CS:GO and BF BC 2 on it with a decent multiplayer, their sells would be sky rocketing.
it's gonna be a weird feeling when the kkk and nazi's are on my switch.
I hope that the scenes they showed are switch footage (but it's probably not)
Time for me to cancel my Wolfenstein PS4 pre-order...
Looks like it's time to buy a lot more memory cards since the Switch has the same hard drive space as a Gameboy
Playing proper Doom while on a bus... that sounds fucking good.
I am not at all trying to sound greedy because this is freaking insane, CAN WE PLEASE GET DISHONORED 2 ON SWITCH?!?!?!
Swastika in a Nintendo Direct? *TRIGGERED*\n\nAll seriousness,  I'm glad Nintendo grew up.
Lets just wait and see if the game actually runs on anything higher than 480p 25fps before we collectively suck Nintendos dick!!!
Yay I can play the games I can never play cause I didn't have the right console
If switch gets doom\n\nOverwatch is a must now.
Is it just me or this smells like fucking downgrade?
looks blurry af tho :/ hope it will be 60fps at least
I can play Doom sitting on the toilet, in my bed, on the bus, in the sewers, on a tree, chilling in a hot bath,
Nice, but it won't sell well. Nintendo needs 3rd party games released on their system either exclusively or at the very least on the same day as the other platforms.
I wonder if doom will run at 60fps. Because the game was designed to run at a solid 60fps and anything less just won't work in my opinion
teh switch has no hardcor gamsssss\nit babby consollllll\nit needs more schuuuut\n*wish gets granted, haters have nothing to complain about*\n....... the gaphics still sux\n*points out it runs on a handheld system*\n*hater cries*\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
XBOX IN 3RD PLACE NOW FOR SURE! SERVES THEM RIGHT THO HAHAHA
I hope people support this, I have DOOM for the PC and it was an incredible experience.  And now that Wolfenstein 2 is coming to the Switch, I might pick it up for that instead of the PC.  Nice one Nintendo!
Gey fucking in there... never got the chance to play doom
I'm cool with some DooM on the go.
I'm glad i didn't buy doom last year. now ill be able to play the best version of the game and I'm really excited to buy and play this.
If you don't have a true understanding of the switches power. Just save your ignorant comments. The switch is slot stronger than alot of you realize.
I never thought Id hear this guy say Nazi
I could get the graphically superior versions on PS4 but I'm getting both of these on Switch.  Portability > Graphics
will those two games be running on 20 fps?
Can you run doom on a machine equal to a xbox 360/ps3??????(the switch)....can it even properly run it with frame rate problems???? And a 32 gb harddrive????? No, you can't....iphones even have 64/128 gb....32 is it????? Thats it????
Watch cod 2018 be on switch.  I'm calling it
Nice announcement ! one thing i noticed is that the downgrade is huge, if they keep the 60 fps stable it will still be a blast to play regardless of the visual quality.
Did honestly never see this comming.\nI think i just came a little bit...
OMG YES! DOOM ON THE SWITCH!
Yay, Doom on low settings and 30 FPS.
Nazis?  In my Nintendo?
This is really a surprise, i don't know how a system wich can't run Overcooked at 30fps will be able to run DOOM on the go... Maybe it's a custom built, or those Switch are gonna melt for sure
Delet this
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
yoooo
wow, megaton announcement :o speaking of which....  fallout 3 plx?
damn the resolution looks sub 720p...
🎶bandz make Nintendo dance baybeeee🎶
Iconic:v
Damn
Holy shit man!!!
WHOO!!! 🤘😆
Fuckin hell yeah
NAAAAAAAANIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Thats incredible
OMG WTF DUDE THIS SHIT IS DOPE !
Noice
me Sorprende que lo pueda correr en la Nintendo switch
Well look at that. Nintendo says the word Nazi and shows the Swastika and the world didn't end. Man fuck these developers and their infantile pandering to the dumbest people on Earth.
low settings 720p 60fps im fine with it just 60fps pleaseeeeee
It the switch can run it, I'd like to see it for Android/iOS soon too
bad quality for nintendo switch\npd: better in pas4 and xbox one\npd: much better in PC Master Race
Older nvidia shield tablet which is less powerfull(half the ram etc) can run crysis 3 on android so surely switch can run about anything on a fixed platform. Super exited gonna buy both! Allready played doom on powerfull pc but gameplay over the graphics and take it on the go muchnwow!1
Doom's online mode is dead : /
Bruh, First Skyrim , then Doom and Wolfenstein, now I belive anything is possible. What's next? Fallout 4?!
Can doom even run 60 fps on the switch?
Yeah, because the Switch can totally run these.\nGuys I was joking, please stop replying !
30fps lol
xbox crossplay, please
AND THEY'VE LISTENED! DECENT THIRD PARTY SUPPORT! THANK FUCK! Took their time since the SNES era though!
So we can expect to run like shit in that shitty console, so why are the nintytards excited?
Nice now I can play the games I already owned at 240p and 15 fps.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! No fucking way... How?! I mean... HOW?!

Wait, what?

Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
Yes! Tomorrow night! 😊
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck

I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.

Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D

I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack.
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run.
Did they get the Bee?
Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again
Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!!
Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day?
Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today....
every time they say bee it duplicates the video
Does Randy have great temples?
Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now?
I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes.....
Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny.
😊Watch my YouTube videos😊

I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011
What seems to be the officer, problem?
I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it
Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class).
Awesome.
Chief, no!
They took dur durrr
amazing work!
DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS
Can't wait!
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees
Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better
Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct?
Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump.
trump commits suicide after south park premiere
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates.
Trumptards
That reference though lol
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
(((South Park)))
LMAO WHITE TRASH
R.I.P. South Park.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Learn the truth about Charlottesville.
I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD
The Alt Right is the future!
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
It's started
Derk a Derrrr
dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
Day tooker jabbsss
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!
this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT!
Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere
Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
YES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASURE. THANK YOU MAT TREY
HAHAHAHA
nice 2 second clip guys.
Perfect
THEY TOOK OUR JOBS!

OHH MYY FUUUCKING GOD ITS BACK! <3
YEAH TIP ASSIST
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!

Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air

Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Or, how about a Stan/Wendy storyline, when he accidentally gets her pregnant.
R.I.P. South Park.
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\n\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\n\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\n\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\n\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\n\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\n\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\n\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\n\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\n\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\n\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.
Hey Alexa\n\n\n\n\nYEW WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!
One town, one relation! Death to mechanization!
🐸💥🔫 Alt right gotta take this L
I was disappointed. Im going to watch it again, to seal my disappointment with the episode, im going to add a layer of philosophy to it witch i probably didn't see amd isn't really their to digest it differently in hopes to find humorous meaning that may not really be there. </3 They should've either stopped at season 17 or stopped making them run together like a bigger longer cut.\n\ntl;dr this episode was disappointing.
Lol I love all the references to HGTV, especially Fixer Upper. xD\nI don't think lots of people really got it in the comments.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again

You have to watch this episode with your Alexa and laugh your ass off like I did...It's hilarious!!!!!
Alexa add titty chips to my shopping list LOL
So uh, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I've been glued to this show for (amazingly) 21 years now and this was the only episode I've ever seen that had nothing funny in it. Maybe Jim Bob, but that's fucking it.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!

Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.
haill to bethesda now wee need fallout 4
Amazing move from Nintendo!!!!
Never expected this
Can we collect amiibos instead of the pop vinyls in doom for the switch?
Vulkan API Boyz!!!!
Fuck playing Doom and Wolfenstein on the go will be so sick
I guess Doom CAN run on anything...huh..
Where did this boner come from
My PC can max out these games but I want the portability, so I'll be buying them for Switch.
Now we're talking!
Did they hire that guy from Polygon to play this build too?
Fucking Doom wasn't expecting that, will buy
Now if only we could get Deus Ex Human Revolution on this thing. Don't feel like getting a Wii U to play that version of the game.\nEDIT: NVM, I take it back, I just remembered the Switch doesn't have Dual Screen functionality.
Switch underpowered umm nope...
The haters are going rage hater mode with this
look like it's time to kill demons and Nazi on the go!!!
Wait, what?
and fifa switch is a fifa 18 ps3 port...
Kinda bummed that the Switch version of Doom won't be getting Snapmap. I'm probably one of those weirdos who really loved the idea of map building on the go.
If we get the next elder scrolls for switch, I would fucking bend the knee to Bethesda
Instead of porting old good games, nintendo is going to burn it self with new games that would barely run on it.\nIf Switch could run CS:GO and BF BC 2 on it with a decent multiplayer, their sells would be sky rocketing.
it's gonna be a weird feeling when the kkk and nazi's are on my switch.
I hope that the scenes they showed are switch footage (but it's probably not)
Time for me to cancel my Wolfenstein PS4 pre-order...
Looks like it's time to buy a lot more memory cards since the Switch has the same hard drive space as a Gameboy
Playing proper Doom while on a bus... that sounds fucking good.
I am not at all trying to sound greedy because this is freaking insane, CAN WE PLEASE GET DISHONORED 2 ON SWITCH?!?!?!
Swastika in a Nintendo Direct? *TRIGGERED*\n\nAll seriousness,  I'm glad Nintendo grew up.
Lets just wait and see if the game actually runs on anything higher than 480p 25fps before we collectively suck Nintendos dick!!!
Yay I can play the games I can never play cause I didn't have the right console
If switch gets doom\n\nOverwatch is a must now.
Is it just me or this smells like fucking downgrade?
looks blurry af tho :/ hope it will be 60fps at least
I can play Doom sitting on the toilet, in my bed, on the bus, in the sewers, on a tree, chilling in a hot bath,
Nice, but it won't sell well. Nintendo needs 3rd party games released on their system either exclusively or at the very least on the same day as the other platforms.
I wonder if doom will run at 60fps. Because the game was designed to run at a solid 60fps and anything less just won't work in my opinion
teh switch has no hardcor gamsssss\nit babby consollllll\nit needs more schuuuut\n*wish gets granted, haters have nothing to complain about*\n....... the gaphics still sux\n*points out it runs on a handheld system*\n*hater cries*\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
XBOX IN 3RD PLACE NOW FOR SURE! SERVES THEM RIGHT THO HAHAHA
I hope people support this, I have DOOM for the PC and it was an incredible experience.  And now that Wolfenstein 2 is coming to the Switch, I might pick it up for that instead of the PC.  Nice one Nintendo!
Gey fucking in there... never got the chance to play doom
I'm cool with some DooM on the go.
I'm glad i didn't buy doom last year. now ill be able to play the best version of the game and I'm really excited to buy and play this.
If you don't have a true understanding of the switches power. Just save your ignorant comments. The switch is slot stronger than alot of you realize.
I never thought Id hear this guy say Nazi
I could get the graphically superior versions on PS4 but I'm getting both of these on Switch.  Portability > Graphics
will those two games be running on 20 fps?
Can you run doom on a machine equal to a xbox 360/ps3??????(the switch)....can it even properly run it with frame rate problems???? And a 32 gb harddrive????? No, you can't....iphones even have 64/128 gb....32 is it????? Thats it????
Watch cod 2018 be on switch.  I'm calling it
Nice announcement ! one thing i noticed is that the downgrade is huge, if they keep the 60 fps stable it will still be a blast to play regardless of the visual quality.
Did honestly never see this comming.\nI think i just came a little bit...
OMG YES! DOOM ON THE SWITCH!
Yay, Doom on low settings and 30 FPS.
Nazis?  In my Nintendo?
This is really a surprise, i don't know how a system wich can't run Overcooked at 30fps will be able to run DOOM on the go... Maybe it's a custom built, or those Switch are gonna melt for sure
Delet this
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
yoooo
wow, megaton announcement :o speaking of which....  fallout 3 plx?
damn the resolution looks sub 720p...
🎶bandz make Nintendo dance baybeeee🎶
Iconic:v
Damn
Holy shit man!!!
WHOO!!! 🤘😆
Fuckin hell yeah
NAAAAAAAANIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Thats incredible
OMG WTF DUDE THIS SHIT IS DOPE !
Noice
me Sorprende que lo pueda correr en la Nintendo switch
Well look at that. Nintendo says the word Nazi and shows the Swastika and the world didn't end. Man fuck these developers and their infantile pandering to the dumbest people on Earth.
low settings 720p 60fps im fine with it just 60fps pleaseeeeee
It the switch can run it, I'd like to see it for Android/iOS soon too
bad quality for nintendo switch\npd: better in pas4 and xbox one\npd: much better in PC Master Race
Older nvidia shield tablet which is less powerfull(half the ram etc) can run crysis 3 on android so surely switch can run about anything on a fixed platform. Super exited gonna buy both! Allready played doom on powerfull pc but gameplay over the graphics and take it on the go muchnwow!1
Doom's online mode is dead : /
Bruh, First Skyrim , then Doom and Wolfenstein, now I belive anything is possible. What's next? Fallout 4?!
Can doom even run 60 fps on the switch?
Yeah, because the Switch can totally run these.\nGuys I was joking, please stop replying !
30fps lol
xbox crossplay, please
AND THEY'VE LISTENED! DECENT THIRD PARTY SUPPORT! THANK FUCK! Took their time since the SNES era though!
So we can expect to run like shit in that shitty console, so why are the nintytards excited?
Nice now I can play the games I already owned at 240p and 15 fps.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! No fucking way... How?! I mean... HOW?!
If Bethesda wants to gain popularity from nintendo fans...\n\n\n\n\n....they're succeeding.
This is massive.\n\nBethesda putting other 3rd parties on notice! Lol
And Bethesda again shows itself to be better than E.A
Wow Nintendo nice call
Bethesda is one of the best allies helping   the Switch if other game developer give it more of a chance Switch will be way more successful. (Now here come the hate comments).
I have the weirdest Boner right now
Hell yeah, thank you id software and Nintendo.
Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.

Wait, what?

Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
Yes! Tomorrow night! 😊
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.
feeling good on a wednesday
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED
TEY TOOK UR JEEEWBSSS
DEY TUK ER JERBS!!!!!!!!
I l southpar
OHH MYY FUUUCKING GOD ITS BACK! <3
YEAH TIP ASSIST
YES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASURE. THANK YOU MAT TREY
HAHAHAHA
nice 2 second clip guys.
Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!
DER TERK ER JERB
I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack.
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run.
Did they get the Bee?
Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again
Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!!
Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day?
Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today....
every time they say bee it duplicates the video
Does Randy have great temples?
Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now?
I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes.....
Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny.
😊Watch my YouTube videos😊
Why is this trending?
I'll get it LMAO
Stupid Trump supporters.😂😂😂
THEY DERK ER DERBS!!!
THE TOOK UER JEEEb!!
DEY TOOK AR JABS!!
Orgasmoooooooooooooos
Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit
I member ☺
I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011
What seems to be the officer, problem?
I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it
Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class).
Awesome.
Chief, no!
They took dur durrr
amazing work!
DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS
Can't wait!
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees
Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better
Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct?
Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump.
trump commits suicide after south park premiere
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates.
Trumptards
That reference though lol
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
(((South Park)))
LMAO WHITE TRASH
R.I.P. South Park.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Learn the truth about Charlottesville.
I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD
The Alt Right is the future!
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
It's started
Derk a Derrrr
dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
Day tooker jabbsss
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
they took your job

Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!
this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT!
Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere
Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.

JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!

Orgasmoooooooooooooos
Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit
I member ☺
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
The Alt Right is the future!
Stupid Trump supporters.😂😂😂
Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Or, how about a Stan/Wendy storyline, when he accidentally gets her pregnant.
R.I.P. South Park.
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\n\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\n\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\n\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\n\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\n\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\n\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\n\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\n\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\n\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\n\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.
Hey Alexa\n\n\n\n\nYEW WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!
One town, one relation! Death to mechanization!
🐸💥🔫 Alt right gotta take this L
I was disappointed. Im going to watch it again, to seal my disappointment with the episode, im going to add a layer of philosophy to it witch i probably didn't see amd isn't really their to digest it differently in hopes to find humorous meaning that may not really be there. </3 They should've either stopped at season 17 or stopped making them run together like a bigger longer cut.\n\ntl;dr this episode was disappointing.
Lol I love all the references to HGTV, especially Fixer Upper. xD\nI don't think lots of people really got it in the comments.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!
this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT!
Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere
Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
You have to watch this episode with your Alexa and laugh your ass off like I did...It's hilarious!!!!!
Alexa add titty chips to my shopping list LOL
So uh, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I've been glued to this show for (amazingly) 21 years now and this was the only episode I've ever seen that had nothing funny in it. Maybe Jim Bob, but that's fucking it.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.

Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!
DER TERK ER JERB
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
DEDER JEBS
South park makes fun of how stupid humanity is. Which means most of the people who like south park are the ones getting made fun of. So why do y'all like it if y'all see haw retarded it makes y'all look.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
feeling good on a wednesday
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Day tooker jabbsss
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
The creators are chickenshit. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this reverse racism bullshit. But, these two won't touch Muhammad, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
DurkEee DURRRR\nTUKRrr JaRBSS
This episode was so weak.
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
horrible horrible horrible episode.\nwow South Park wtf.\nwtf. wtf. wtf. wtf. why why why are you making your show shit now. it used to be great and now it sucks balls with this first episode. this is the best you could come up with??!? \nwowwww woww oowwowoeifjdjhdkfjsmfidnekdfucksouthparknowwtf
political randy episode\nsigh
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
(S)ALT RIGHT
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
shit episode
*CUCKED*\n*U*\n*C*\n*K*\n*E*\n*D*

Why won't they bring back chef...there are so many people that can do that voice spot on, just hire one
Alt-right nazis tears tastes so good...hmmm
R.I.P. South Park.
Idk this episode wasnt that funny.
Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air
Waited, watched and now disappointed.. South Park is dying.. Worst episode ever.
Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..

Life is unfair!

He's so humble & cute. I'm glad he's proud of his childhood acting. Most child stars are so bitter.
He looks almost EXACTLY THE SAME! Oh my god!
Omg he seems SO genuine and nice!
I thought Malcolm would run for president now
The song and his personality came together very beautifully. He was very humble and the whole thing was very touching.  His musicality was excellent and his frame and posture were vey good, they kept body contact during the whole dance. However,  there were no heel leads, When he stepped back he didn't glide on the floor, there was almost no sway and his arms were really stiff. It was a beautiful, lyrical, touching foxtrot but technically it was weak. a 6 from me.
I enjoyed this performance.
I freaking love Frankie! \nYou know some people are like, 'Don't call me Carlton..' 😂😂😂😂😂
Frankie Muniz is the man! I hope he wins he's always been a cool guy and never let the fame go to his head
I want him to win.
i see a male contender 👏👌
 you know call me Malcolm I'll probably respond  😂😂😂
It's cute seeing him so shy 😂
Whitney is 23, Frankie is 31... seriously doubt her dad is same age!   LOL        LOVE Frankie!!!!!!    So humble!
Frankie looks amazing!
Whitney got ass
where's reese
Life is unfair!
He's good!
That was beautiful I love him
0:37 malcom still breaking the 4th wall after all these years. XD
Wow all they gave was a 6 shit they cheap i think he did atleast a 23
He is so handsome
He is just the most adorable thing lol he seems super cool to be around which is awesome to know that someone from one of my favorite shows is super cool haha
Cody Banks...ok.
I loved Frankie when I was younger he was always my fav actor to watch now I'm 16 about to be 17 in a month and I still remember him as my first crush and he danced to Harry's song now I'm honestly going to die a happy girl😂❤️
Loooooved this dance!!!  What a surprise! Loved it ❤️
What nonsense that score they gave him was trash!!! He should have gotten more than that😡😡
I ship them!!❤
What's the name of the song they are dancing to? Thanks!
Agent Cody Banks, Lizzie McGuire guest appearance and Big Fat Liar. Always on an adventure it seems.
i do like his humility, I like his sincerity, not pompous at all :)
Awww so cute, love him
I thought frankie was dead?
Frankie bears a strong resemblance to joe montana.just add some curly locks.
He seems like a nice relate-able guy. Hope he does well!
Did he stumble at 1:48? It looked like they tripped over each other's feet
I was watching others performances to see if they were going to use any of Harrys song and I literally screamed when SOTT came on. \n\np.s. I also watched the other performances to rate them not just because of Harry
He could be good, but I think he needs to widen his arms movment and slow them down, to make the movment look more gracious...
He is so sweet omg.
I love him 💟Frankie
What a sweet, humble guy - I wasn't expecting him to be like that. I hope he grows through this and does really well.
he's so cute!!  been a huge fan of his for years, so they got my votes.
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
How the hell is Frankie old enough to be her dad?\nOr was she just kidding?\nB/c, like, he's 31, which is younger than my parents were when I was born.
He's good! I'll vote for him
Frankie Muniz is always been one of my favorite actors. I was really sad that he retired so early. I'm very glad to see his return
Malcom in the middle class.
also in what world is 480p hd
Malcome ....awkward......

2:10 OH MY GOD!!! I've never seen that side of her!! It feels weird, but I'm glad she's having fun and trying new things!! :D
Voted Lindsay & Mark!!! I want them to win sooooo bad!!!!
Im so proud of her!!!!!! Omg i cant even process!!🔥🔥🔥😘❤️💕💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
That footwork has me shook
Len obviously never saw any of her stage performances if he wasn't expecting her high level of foot movement.  She has invented many of her own dance moves and steps on stage and incorporated Celtic dance in many of her choreography.
I haven't watched DWTS since the first few seasons but I've come to watch Lindsey!
I'm so proud of her! I remember when she auditioned for AGT!
just saw that jimmy kimmel picked derek fisher to win----don't think so!!---lindsey and mark to win!!!
this is such a creative pair, and I really enjoy that she seems to inspire Mark to bring out his A-game
Love her hope she goes far
2:18 this part was the best of this dance show , she was so perfect
Amazing 💛 I'm calling it! Either she wins or she's a finalist!
She's really good!
How about the NIKKI Bella oneeee
I'm for her !
And then they fucked.  And it got awkward.
UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE! Lindsey is so talented it blows my mind!!!!
thank god with that 46,000 views that it's on the trending page. how much does youtube charge to go on the trending page?
Derek Hough was in her video The Arena
Lindsey Stirling and Jordan Fisher are the only reasons I will be watching this season. Top 2 anyone?
WOW ! Luv her music, but DANG ! Great 1st dance ! Choreography,  chemistry, sharp, on rhythm and they both looked like they were having fun.
I love her! She is my biggest inspiration in music and all things in life! ♥
I honestly had no clue which person was the professional dancer and who wasn't 💃 🕺🏽🙌
They killed it yesterday! 1:14 XD
The Dance The Music and The Couple just PERFECT Yes!!
I've seen her do spins..I knew she had it
Lindsey rocked it. She's a contender! Awesome lady amazing talent
one of the best dances by far
These two are going to go far
Can you upload Nikki's dance?
She's so bubbly I love her!!
HD yeah right !!..>.<.. 480p rubbish, this need to be 1080p -_-
Woohoo Lindsey!!!! You r my inspiration!!!! I expected nothing less of you!!! You danced the night away! Bless you for round 2!!! ^-^
Omgod Lindsey.  She already won.  I love her! She has to win all the way.
WOW!! What a way to finish the night ! It was, without any doubt, the best dance of the night. She showed lots of natural ability, impeccable musicality and great personality. Mark's choreography was very,very intricate and she handled it amazingly. She really felt the rhythm of the music, it was gorgeous. Haven't said that, she does need to work on her arms (they were a bit bizarre) and her forward lock-step wasn't good, technically speaking, but overall it was amazing. An 8 from me.
She's sooo perfect !  Love her so much **^** my queen  <3
Love Lindsey! I hope she continues to do well and she makes it to the end. Mark and Lindsey seem like a great combo!
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much Media Galactic! #teamstark

just saw that jimmy kimmel picked derek fisher to win----don't think so!!---lindsey and mark to win!!!
this is such a creative pair, and I really enjoy that she seems to inspire Mark to bring out his A-game
Love her hope she goes far
WOW!! What a way to finish the night ! It was, without any doubt, the best dance of the night. She showed lots of natural ability, impeccable musicality and great personality. Mark's choreography was very,very intricate and she handled it amazingly. She really felt the rhythm of the music, it was gorgeous. Haven't said that, she does need to work on her arms (they were a bit bizarre) and her forward lock-step wasn't good, technically speaking, but overall it was amazing. An 8 from me.
2:18 this part was the best of this dance show , she was so perfect
Amazing 💛 I'm calling it! Either she wins or she's a finalist!
She's really good!
How about the NIKKI Bella oneeee
Omgod Lindsey.  She already won.  I love her! She has to win all the way.
She's sooo perfect !  Love her so much **^** my queen  <3
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much Media Galactic! #teamstark
I'm for her !
This makes me so happy!! I love when good things happen to good people! People shouldn't be shocked she's amazing!
you know dont you ,your in it to win it go girl
She has that sexy nerd thing going for her.
I haven’t watched the show in so long and have forgotten how tough these judges can be! They should have got 8s across the board.
So glad you uploaded this thank you!! Lindsey and Mark are my fav couple this year. Their chemistry is amazing and I know their choreography and costumes are going to blow us away this season. I am rooting for them to win!!!
thank god with that 46,000 views that it's on the trending page. how much does youtube charge to go on the trending page?
Derek Hough was in her video The Arena
WOW ! Luv her music, but DANG ! Great 1st dance ! Choreography,  chemistry, sharp, on rhythm and they both looked like they were having fun.
I love her! She is my biggest inspiration in music and all things in life! ♥
I honestly had no clue which person was the professional dancer and who wasn't 💃 🕺🏽🙌
They killed it yesterday! 1:14 XD
The Dance The Music and The Couple just PERFECT Yes!!
one of the best dances by far
These two are going to go far
UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE! Lindsey is so talented it blows my mind!!!!
Can you upload Nikki's dance?
She's so bubbly I love her!!
HD yeah right !!..>.<.. 480p rubbish, this need to be 1080p -_-
I've seen her do spins..I knew she had it
Lindsey rocked it. She's a contender! Awesome lady amazing talent
Woohoo Lindsey!!!! You r my inspiration!!!! I expected nothing less of you!!! You danced the night away! Bless you for round 2!!! ^-^
Love Lindsey! I hope she continues to do well and she makes it to the end. Mark and Lindsey seem like a great combo!
Pleaseeee
UNDERSCORED!!!

Lindsey is amazing !
Great!!---and only 7's from Carrie Ann and Bruno???  Hello???

It's between her and Jordan....  it Jordan will def win
I wish she was not in a cult. She is cute. The cult part is creepy.
hi, can you post the opening number?
And then they fucked.  And it got awkward.
song title pls
7's? Wtf do they give bad dances?

Lindsey Stirling and Jordan Fisher are the only reasons I will be watching this season. Top 2 anyone?
people from YouTube are considered stars now? must be running out of contestants...

Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
on my console it dont work :(
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
I can’t get it to work. Help?
I'm tearing up right here, legit
WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy

岩田「直接！」\n(iwata) (Choku setsu !)
Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
It doesnt work
Faked for views
Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.
This isn't working for me...
i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
I'm not a fan of mute videos.
did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.
Someone buy this buy a better camera.

Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.
Are you supposed to press any of the top shoulder buttons when you do this?
Wtf is this on trending

Top 10 Creepypasta Rituals
Oh yeah reaaaall cool guy,  😑
Stupid .  Why you no narrate
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Iwata almost ran Nintendo into the fucking ground
Nintendo was so afraid of losing money that they put the shittiest fucking golf game in it rather than something that's good, good on you Nintendo
Due to the overwhelming response to this video, I felt it appropriate to give an explanation.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkAvnnFICE&feature=youtu.be
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
As much as this is seems a tear jerker, its best to not open the program as it is a Omamori, per this twitter https://twitter.com/sprsk/status/910295200228032512?lang=en
I couldnt get it to work on my switch no matter how much I tried can anybody help me
I need to connect to the monitor and demonstrate it
I've tried this three times and no luck
One of the coolest things I've ever seen.
its not showing a thing there to allow me to change the system time and date
Do you get to keep the game, or is it only playable on July 11th?
That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')
How the fuck did you figure that out??
Goat fire brigade'  helps save Spain from forest fires\nhttps://youtu.be/ImFJAw2SnZg
I understood how the 3ds had all types of hidden games, but why would Nintendo make you summon a game?
Cool video paying your respects to him. 👍
i used to rock this game on my nes
Hey that's some pretty good asmr
thank you for posting this.
I did the exact same thing and yet i didnt get it
May I put forward a proposition; you shout me out, and I reciprocate (Do the same)
Oh man, I remember that game.
This is on trending
i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
I don't say this often for actions made by people, but this is beautiful...
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
success
Clickbait.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream

Get a pc
How did someone figure all of this out?
is it possible to do this without hacking your switch?
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I can’t get it to work. Help?
fucking moron can't speek? holy fuck wts is this? get cancer and die.
check.  out.    watch.     now.   \nshared.    my.      video.    2017.

This video was made on my friends birthday
Holy moly can you speak or not?
on my console it dont work :(
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.

If she doesn't win I will be shocked to say the least.
2:10 OH MY GOD!!! I've never seen that side of her!! It feels weird, but I'm glad she's having fun and trying new things!! :D
Voted Lindsay & Mark!!! I want them to win sooooo bad!!!!
Im so proud of her!!!!!! Omg i cant even process!!🔥🔥🔥😘❤️💕💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
That footwork has me shook
Len obviously never saw any of her stage performances if he wasn't expecting her high level of foot movement.  She has invented many of her own dance moves and steps on stage and incorporated Celtic dance in many of her choreography.
I haven't watched DWTS since the first few seasons but I've come to watch Lindsey!
I'm so proud of her! I remember when she auditioned for AGT!
just saw that jimmy kimmel picked derek fisher to win----don't think so!!---lindsey and mark to win!!!
this is such a creative pair, and I really enjoy that she seems to inspire Mark to bring out his A-game
Love her hope she goes far
2:18 this part was the best of this dance show , she was so perfect
Amazing 💛 I'm calling it! Either she wins or she's a finalist!
She's really good!
How about the NIKKI Bella oneeee
I'm for her !
And then they fucked.  And it got awkward.
UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE! Lindsey is so talented it blows my mind!!!!
thank god with that 46,000 views that it's on the trending page. how much does youtube charge to go on the trending page?
Derek Hough was in her video The Arena
Lindsey Stirling and Jordan Fisher are the only reasons I will be watching this season. Top 2 anyone?
WOW ! Luv her music, but DANG ! Great 1st dance ! Choreography,  chemistry, sharp, on rhythm and they both looked like they were having fun.
I love her! She is my biggest inspiration in music and all things in life! ♥
I honestly had no clue which person was the professional dancer and who wasn't 💃 🕺🏽🙌
They killed it yesterday! 1:14 XD
The Dance The Music and The Couple just PERFECT Yes!!
I've seen her do spins..I knew she had it
Lindsey rocked it. She's a contender! Awesome lady amazing talent
one of the best dances by far
These two are going to go far
Can you upload Nikki's dance?
She's so bubbly I love her!!
HD yeah right !!..>.<.. 480p rubbish, this need to be 1080p -_-
Woohoo Lindsey!!!! You r my inspiration!!!! I expected nothing less of you!!! You danced the night away! Bless you for round 2!!! ^-^
Omgod Lindsey.  She already won.  I love her! She has to win all the way.
WOW!! What a way to finish the night ! It was, without any doubt, the best dance of the night. She showed lots of natural ability, impeccable musicality and great personality. Mark's choreography was very,very intricate and she handled it amazingly. She really felt the rhythm of the music, it was gorgeous. Haven't said that, she does need to work on her arms (they were a bit bizarre) and her forward lock-step wasn't good, technically speaking, but overall it was amazing. An 8 from me.
She's sooo perfect !  Love her so much **^** my queen  <3
Love Lindsey! I hope she continues to do well and she makes it to the end. Mark and Lindsey seem like a great combo!
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much Media Galactic! #teamstark

She has that sexy nerd thing going for her.
I haven’t watched the show in so long and have forgotten how tough these judges can be! They should have got 8s across the board.
So glad you uploaded this thank you!! Lindsey and Mark are my fav couple this year. Their chemistry is amazing and I know their choreography and costumes are going to blow us away this season. I am rooting for them to win!!!

I feel like michael bay directed this
there i was ... hoping for a wehrmacht campain.
Still a few butthurt nerds over CoD WWII still having women and poc in the game because it's not historically accurate. So if you do some research, you'll find that in other countries, women served in combat, as well as poc in the U.S. They were separated but, still saw combat.
When they will finally do a new story line at the Eastern front, Norther region, Italy, Balkans, Egypt, Philippines and something involving other nations? It's called World War II for a reason, not American Hero Campaign 23!
Hey! That's pretty good!
Can someone give a name of the soundtrack?
Oy vey, this will be good!
I saw swastikas like if u saw them
no more wall jumping robots i'm happy yeeaahh i got motion sick on blops 3
How do people not know the difference between in game graphics and pre rendered cinematics at this point...
When graphics are better than real life
1:38 - 1:39\n\nDid you notice? When he hit him with the machine gun, he did not even touch him!
Daym... the graphics and the campaign is too nasty😍
2:01 this is what i like to see!
Best game war ever. T
I have a feeling that cod ww2 is gonna have a great and emotional campaign (probably) just like the one in cod waw
Shut up and take my money! ... Oh wait, they already did... Shut up and give me that game! :D
2017, cod retards are still falling for CGI xDDDDDDDDDDDDD Idiots, that's not CoD WW2 graphic, THESE ARE JUST CUTSCENES. Cod graphic will be 100 times worse like always.
Looks like the zombies and campaign will be better than the actual multiplayer
This Is What I've Been Waiting For!! So Hyped ❤️
tbh Bf1 campaign is so dull and too fast, i hope Cod Ww2 bring something new to me, my last cod is Aw
Get ready for grenade spam on veteran :)
no soviet union in CoD about WW2, gg
Game looks amazing a cod in recent years that I am Excited for.
You can win everyone \nPeople moan if it's future bullshit or they moan if it's in the past \nMake your Bloody mind up\nNo wonder Activision can't decide straight away what game to make as you half of the people wanting the opposite thing
this looks cool, but knowing call of duty, it's gonna be about 6 short and repetitive missions long
This better be good!
So we're not gonna be fighting Japan in this game?
I can't wait that game
Greece fought 2 its a shame that we didnt get even an honourable mention ;(
THIS looks like real life game
I SEE A SWASTIKA
i like m1 garand sound at the end
Wasn't expecting that, good job.
So psyched. Finally I can return to COD after years of considering the series a joke
Thats the cod been looking for .....
Wait for someone to get offended that there is no black soldiers...
man too bad new games costs so much I'd get this for the campaign, might play multiplayer a bit but mostly for the campaign
That's more like it. Now just get rid of microtransactions, quickscoping snipers, and pre-teen  squeakers in the multiplayer, and we have a winner.
Im more excited to play the campaign than multiplayer
Bf1 will be always better
Reminds me a lot of Band of Brothers.
this the real cod and not the future shits like last 3
trailer be like Christopher Nolan and the game be like Michael bay.
When will the time travellers come in and give the US the exo suits
Should be a movie
I thought this video has age limitation, but why theres still some kids that got away and dislikes this video ????
History is written by the victor.  Don't judge, without hearing both sides.
Where do gamers find all the accurate weapons
2:02 there, can you people stop bitching now?
Now we just need an Espionage mission in the concentration camp.And a soviet front mission
I’ve pre ordered it the beta was sick
Woah there sledgehammer, a swastika? Oh boy I can see a bunch of people screaming.
Of course, totally centred around the American effort in the war. Who joined 2 years late, and waited for Europe and particularly Britain to suffer, while the Russians nearly buckled under the German onslaught. Even if the game is set on solely the Western front, where are the British? Canadians? ANZACS? No where cause obviously the Americans did all the heavy lifting. People forget that the Royal Navy enabled D-day in its entirety, and that the Empire contributed the 2nd largest contingent of landing troops by a close margin to the Yanks. At least Battlefield 1 had the decency to show that all of Europe and America was embroiled in the global conflict that was Ww1.
Saving private Ryan did it better
looks like i finally like something about this game
Great trailer but the game won't be a quarter as good
Say what you will about Cod WW2 but this is DOPE
Supply drops ruined Call of Duty.
The campaign looks really good. However I can't shake this feeling about MP that just makes me not wanna play it, like it's just meh. Zombies should be good too. I can't justify $60 if I'm not gonna play MP so I gotta wait for a sale 😪
A 2 minute video proves nothing. Cutscenes don't prove anything. Games are about GAMEPLAY.
1:50 did this actually happen in my life time???? we are there I believe. I can't tell whats real and whats not anymore
Good. There's swastikas in the game.
One Good thing that we learn from this video\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThey finally put the real swastikas
The campaign better give me these same.chills if not.I'm suing the whole universe
why does my man have a tommy gun? huh that explains the snow, didn't know this game was set in Chicago...
Chinese war sword soliders theme is your last chance to competition BF1.
I never watched game graphic like this !! ''O'
Yes I love playing as Americans in every videogame I play
usually I say bf1 wins but when it comes to story mode cod wins every single time
Why does the m1 Garand sound like a laser 😂
I watch it over and over and over again
AH YES THE SIX MILLIONS OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLES WERE KILLED IGNORE OTHER COUNTRES SCHLOMO HEHEHE
I see a old character from advanced warfare the general. So lame and weak
Will they include the battle for ittler castle cuz it would be awesome since German and American fought together to defend the castle from the ss soldier
0:55 Well, hello Tom Hanks!
I cant see the videoD:
call of duty homecoming
Unlikers are Squad players.
this reminds me of Unbroken
Big red 1
nice work..
sweet
1:9 Jake Gyllenhaal from behind!!
What a swastika 0_0
Omoha beach?
Ah, I saw that cheeky preorder bonus.
2:04 when i saw 2:02
DAMN
swastikas are back boi !!!!
2:02 *HAPPY?*
Jonathan Tucker from kingdom
2:02 swastikas is back!
Very impressive!
FINALLY, SWASTIKA!!!
Like saving private ryan again.
1:50 false advertising smh
Something something swastikas something something women something something hype something
0.57 its josh duhamel voice?
Weird didn't know they were making another battlefield.
Probably best Cod trailer EVER!!! I fell like this game is going to be amazing!
AMAZING, i can learn history much better now.. Just like in the movie and i'm sure soon they'll make Call of Duty : THE PACIFIC..  i guaranteed it, can't wait for it!
So we're going back to the old classic style cod huh? Well a lot of people complained about the futuristic stuff they added especially in multiplayer. I guess this will satisfy them. Me personally I'm ok with both styles. What do you guys think?
Disappointed with this game! \nThis doesn't mention Russians fighting for Europe
I better be able to kill Hitler
nice game but my computer can't handle this (can't reach req)
Okay guys you finally got your damn Swastikas, Now can we shut up and enjoy the game or are we going to complain about some trivial thing next?
Reminds me of Big Red One a little bit
It looks like they spent their three years making this trailer instead of the actual game itself
Much better than the multi for sure
Why american soldier hide his dogtag when captured and being POW by german army?
It would be cool if they have a cameo with the squad from Cod 2 Big Red One, still remember Brooklyn's death
Bad. Your ideas get lost...
The graphics it's just beautiful
YOU HAVE EARNED MY SUBSCRIPTION
Where's my boy Tank Dempsey?\n\n\n\nit's a joke
Too bad the in game graphics won't be nearly as good as this😂😂
Finally! See Activision, this is all we wanted!
Wow looks amazing!! Hope there's a D-Day mission
I'm so happy has this is amazing
It has come full circle now
I can't wait to play it.  Looks good.
Are they gonna hire Matt Damon for this mov-- I mean game?
My cousin Mike helped build this game, he said they used mostly copper wire and tape for the graphics. Can't wait to see it play out.
This is going to be good
These are men, OUR MEN! When did you forget?
This is the call of duty that we need. It brings back the memories of the game that people will enjoy to play
Since they're arm most likely banned from using the SS lightning bolts as a symbol in this game, but they were still able to find a way to show the guy at 1:10 is SS. Being interested in history, specifically WW2 you can see that an eagle on the left arm was part of the SS uniform asides from the lightning bolts.
*pause at ****2:02* im buying this game now
There is no such thing as a good call of duty campaign.
BUT WILL THESE GRAPHICS BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE GAMEPLAY!?! :/
Sledgehammer please do not mess this up
Meine Ehre heißt Treue,Only a handful of the people in this comment section will unterstand the significance of this phrase. This game looks amazing congrats to Sledgehammer I think they're going to hit the spot of what is a great Call of Duty, but unfortunately I believe this generation who have been force-fed since their earliest years a narrow one sided view of this war will never truly understand what this war was like for the Germans or even the Axis countries in general, and the everlasting effect it has had on its people. As they say History is written by the victors... Just my 2 cents
The community will find a way to complain, don't worry.
World at war has been my favorite campaign lets seen if this can beat it
Looking forward to the campaign
2:02 THE SWASTICAS ARE BACK
Only thing cod is good at the story
Ready For World War 2!
Why does that German at 1:13 look like thefatrat's face?
Okay, they added Swastikas. For all the people who were complaining that there are none, you can shut up now.
Walther P38 instead of Luger P08 but never mind...
It looks like a movie my gawd
Dont give a damn about multiplayer, this is what I wanted
Bad thing is the actual game won’t look like this
0:29 That is Kingpin from Advanced warfare campaign.
is this a gamo or a fuckung movie lol no hate i like it so buy WWII
I sense a Battle of the Bulge scenario.
This looks so good but I hope they put time in other modes as well unlike infinity ward with infinite warfare
Better have the intervention in this one
I thought there weren't gonna be swastikas?
Looks like a live action movie
Well this is what we waited for.
I would love it if their story is gonna work like a single story in battlefield 1, like where there isnt constant fighting and theres parts where you have to move slow and be quiet and they don't hold your hand through it like they have done so much recently
.......this is the future of gaming......
More American crap, you guys realise the war started before 1941...
Infinite warfare is still better
Looks good, just kinda wish you could play as the good guys.
1:00 we thought we knew what war would be like... but nothing prepared us for this Actvision's reaction to historical inaccuracy hate
This looks like a movie!
How come every cod trailer that comes out i always end up watching it over and over
Is this a game or a movie, I can't tell
dday for the first time in 12 years...
Please keep in mind these arent ingame graphics. This is a cinematic short, these are typically always much more fleshed out. The game itself isn't anything special.
Americans didn’t do everything \nIt was the Soviets
If you look at 2:01\nYou know we're getting a hell of a good campaign
who else is looking forward for this game to drop or is it just me
1:59 now that's just badass.
I hope we get to see Adolf Hitler in this
SWASTIKAS! 2:02
Same old
Good Good
This looks really good
What story?
Swastikas confirmed
This looks dope as hell
Looks awesome
2:01 pause waw , feel like watching BoB ....
I STILL CANT BELIVE ITS NOT BUTTER
Soviet history?
Hi

Graphics are amazing
Finally caught on
Saving Private Ryan: The Game
2:06 RIP BATTLEFIELD 1
Love how every German looks horribly evil and not normal men and boys trying to survive
Why did they do this instead of the pacific front or at least the African front I'm not saying this is bad oh no just the western front is over used.
Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
on my console it dont work :(
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
I can’t get it to work. Help?
I'm tearing up right here, legit
WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy

岩田「直接！」\n(iwata) (Choku setsu !)
Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
It doesnt work
Faked for views
Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.
This isn't working for me...
i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
I'm not a fan of mute videos.
did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.
Someone buy this buy a better camera.
Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;

So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄

i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.

I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer

Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.

That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')

I just got a switch and cant get it to launch...brand new but it wont launch
Wow, how did this pass 7/11/2017?
I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer
Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.
Are you supposed to press any of the top shoulder buttons when you do this?
This video was made on my friends birthday
Holy moly can you speak or not?
on my console it dont work :(
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
fake

He's so humble & cute. I'm glad he's proud of his childhood acting. Most child stars are so bitter.
He looks almost EXACTLY THE SAME! Oh my god!
Omg he seems SO genuine and nice!
I thought Malcolm would run for president now
The song and his personality came together very beautifully. He was very humble and the whole thing was very touching.  His musicality was excellent and his frame and posture were vey good, they kept body contact during the whole dance. However,  there were no heel leads, When he stepped back he didn't glide on the floor, there was almost no sway and his arms were really stiff. It was a beautiful, lyrical, touching foxtrot but technically it was weak. a 6 from me.
I enjoyed this performance.
I freaking love Frankie! \nYou know some people are like, 'Don't call me Carlton..' 😂😂😂😂😂
Frankie Muniz is the man! I hope he wins he's always been a cool guy and never let the fame go to his head
I want him to win.
i see a male contender 👏👌
 you know call me Malcolm I'll probably respond  😂😂😂
It's cute seeing him so shy 😂
Whitney is 23, Frankie is 31... seriously doubt her dad is same age!   LOL        LOVE Frankie!!!!!!    So humble!
Frankie looks amazing!
Whitney got ass
where's reese
Life is unfair!
He's good!
That was beautiful I love him
0:37 malcom still breaking the 4th wall after all these years. XD
Wow all they gave was a 6 shit they cheap i think he did atleast a 23
He is so handsome
He is just the most adorable thing lol he seems super cool to be around which is awesome to know that someone from one of my favorite shows is super cool haha
Cody Banks...ok.
I loved Frankie when I was younger he was always my fav actor to watch now I'm 16 about to be 17 in a month and I still remember him as my first crush and he danced to Harry's song now I'm honestly going to die a happy girl😂❤️
Loooooved this dance!!!  What a surprise! Loved it ❤️
What nonsense that score they gave him was trash!!! He should have gotten more than that😡😡
I ship them!!❤
What's the name of the song they are dancing to? Thanks!
Agent Cody Banks, Lizzie McGuire guest appearance and Big Fat Liar. Always on an adventure it seems.
i do like his humility, I like his sincerity, not pompous at all :)
Awww so cute, love him
I thought frankie was dead?
Frankie bears a strong resemblance to joe montana.just add some curly locks.
He seems like a nice relate-able guy. Hope he does well!
Did he stumble at 1:48? It looked like they tripped over each other's feet
I was watching others performances to see if they were going to use any of Harrys song and I literally screamed when SOTT came on. \n\np.s. I also watched the other performances to rate them not just because of Harry
He could be good, but I think he needs to widen his arms movment and slow them down, to make the movment look more gracious...
He is so sweet omg.
I love him 💟Frankie
What a sweet, humble guy - I wasn't expecting him to be like that. I hope he grows through this and does really well.
he's so cute!!  been a huge fan of his for years, so they got my votes.
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
How the hell is Frankie old enough to be her dad?\nOr was she just kidding?\nB/c, like, he's 31, which is younger than my parents were when I was born.
He's good! I'll vote for him
Frankie Muniz is always been one of my favorite actors. I was really sad that he retired so early. I'm very glad to see his return
Malcom in the middle class.
also in what world is 480p hd
Malcome ....awkward......
bitch has a thicc ass damnn
Friend zone Frankie
Also Frankie did so good
IS FRANKIE MUNIZ SANE AGAIN OR??
I feel like michael bay directed this
there i was ... hoping for a wehrmacht campain.
Still a few butthurt nerds over CoD WWII still having women and poc in the game because it's not historically accurate. So if you do some research, you'll find that in other countries, women served in combat, as well as poc in the U.S. They were separated but, still saw combat.
When they will finally do a new story line at the Eastern front, Norther region, Italy, Balkans, Egypt, Philippines and something involving other nations? It's called World War II for a reason, not American Hero Campaign 23!
Hey! That's pretty good!
Can someone give a name of the soundtrack?
Oy vey, this will be good!
I saw swastikas like if u saw them
no more wall jumping robots i'm happy yeeaahh i got motion sick on blops 3
How do people not know the difference between in game graphics and pre rendered cinematics at this point...
When graphics are better than real life
1:38 - 1:39\n\nDid you notice? When he hit him with the machine gun, he did not even touch him!
Daym... the graphics and the campaign is too nasty😍
2:01 this is what i like to see!
Best game war ever. T
I have a feeling that cod ww2 is gonna have a great and emotional campaign (probably) just like the one in cod waw
Shut up and take my money! ... Oh wait, they already did... Shut up and give me that game! :D
2017, cod retards are still falling for CGI xDDDDDDDDDDDDD Idiots, that's not CoD WW2 graphic, THESE ARE JUST CUTSCENES. Cod graphic will be 100 times worse like always.
Looks like the zombies and campaign will be better than the actual multiplayer
This Is What I've Been Waiting For!! So Hyped ❤️
tbh Bf1 campaign is so dull and too fast, i hope Cod Ww2 bring something new to me, my last cod is Aw
Get ready for grenade spam on veteran :)
no soviet union in CoD about WW2, gg
Game looks amazing a cod in recent years that I am Excited for.
You can win everyone \nPeople moan if it's future bullshit or they moan if it's in the past \nMake your Bloody mind up\nNo wonder Activision can't decide straight away what game to make as you half of the people wanting the opposite thing
this looks cool, but knowing call of duty, it's gonna be about 6 short and repetitive missions long
This better be good!
So we're not gonna be fighting Japan in this game?
I can't wait that game
Greece fought 2 its a shame that we didnt get even an honourable mention ;(
THIS looks like real life game
I SEE A SWASTIKA
i like m1 garand sound at the end
Wasn't expecting that, good job.
So psyched. Finally I can return to COD after years of considering the series a joke
Thats the cod been looking for .....
Wait for someone to get offended that there is no black soldiers...
man too bad new games costs so much I'd get this for the campaign, might play multiplayer a bit but mostly for the campaign
That's more like it. Now just get rid of microtransactions, quickscoping snipers, and pre-teen  squeakers in the multiplayer, and we have a winner.
Im more excited to play the campaign than multiplayer
Bf1 will be always better
Reminds me a lot of Band of Brothers.
this the real cod and not the future shits like last 3
trailer be like Christopher Nolan and the game be like Michael bay.
When will the time travellers come in and give the US the exo suits
Should be a movie
I thought this video has age limitation, but why theres still some kids that got away and dislikes this video ????
History is written by the victor.  Don't judge, without hearing both sides.
Where do gamers find all the accurate weapons
2:02 there, can you people stop bitching now?
Now we just need an Espionage mission in the concentration camp.And a soviet front mission
I’ve pre ordered it the beta was sick
Woah there sledgehammer, a swastika? Oh boy I can see a bunch of people screaming.
Of course, totally centred around the American effort in the war. Who joined 2 years late, and waited for Europe and particularly Britain to suffer, while the Russians nearly buckled under the German onslaught. Even if the game is set on solely the Western front, where are the British? Canadians? ANZACS? No where cause obviously the Americans did all the heavy lifting. People forget that the Royal Navy enabled D-day in its entirety, and that the Empire contributed the 2nd largest contingent of landing troops by a close margin to the Yanks. At least Battlefield 1 had the decency to show that all of Europe and America was embroiled in the global conflict that was Ww1.
Saving private Ryan did it better
looks like i finally like something about this game
Great trailer but the game won't be a quarter as good
Say what you will about Cod WW2 but this is DOPE
Supply drops ruined Call of Duty.
The campaign looks really good. However I can't shake this feeling about MP that just makes me not wanna play it, like it's just meh. Zombies should be good too. I can't justify $60 if I'm not gonna play MP so I gotta wait for a sale 😪
A 2 minute video proves nothing. Cutscenes don't prove anything. Games are about GAMEPLAY.
1:50 did this actually happen in my life time???? we are there I believe. I can't tell whats real and whats not anymore
Good. There's swastikas in the game.
One Good thing that we learn from this video\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThey finally put the real swastikas
The campaign better give me these same.chills if not.I'm suing the whole universe
why does my man have a tommy gun? huh that explains the snow, didn't know this game was set in Chicago...
Chinese war sword soliders theme is your last chance to competition BF1.
I never watched game graphic like this !! ''O'
Yes I love playing as Americans in every videogame I play
usually I say bf1 wins but when it comes to story mode cod wins every single time
Why does the m1 Garand sound like a laser 😂
I watch it over and over and over again
AH YES THE SIX MILLIONS OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLES WERE KILLED IGNORE OTHER COUNTRES SCHLOMO HEHEHE
I see a old character from advanced warfare the general. So lame and weak
Will they include the battle for ittler castle cuz it would be awesome since German and American fought together to defend the castle from the ss soldier
0:55 Well, hello Tom Hanks!
I cant see the videoD:
call of duty homecoming
Unlikers are Squad players.
this reminds me of Unbroken
Big red 1
nice work..
sweet
1:9 Jake Gyllenhaal from behind!!
What a swastika 0_0
Omoha beach?
Ah, I saw that cheeky preorder bonus.
2:04 when i saw 2:02
DAMN
swastikas are back boi !!!!
2:02 *HAPPY?*
Jonathan Tucker from kingdom
2:02 swastikas is back!
Very impressive!
FINALLY, SWASTIKA!!!
Like saving private ryan again.
1:50 false advertising smh
Something something swastikas something something women something something hype something
0.57 its josh duhamel voice?
Weird didn't know they were making another battlefield.
Probably best Cod trailer EVER!!! I fell like this game is going to be amazing!
AMAZING, i can learn history much better now.. Just like in the movie and i'm sure soon they'll make Call of Duty : THE PACIFIC..  i guaranteed it, can't wait for it!
So we're going back to the old classic style cod huh? Well a lot of people complained about the futuristic stuff they added especially in multiplayer. I guess this will satisfy them. Me personally I'm ok with both styles. What do you guys think?
Disappointed with this game! \nThis doesn't mention Russians fighting for Europe
I better be able to kill Hitler
nice game but my computer can't handle this (can't reach req)
Okay guys you finally got your damn Swastikas, Now can we shut up and enjoy the game or are we going to complain about some trivial thing next?
Reminds me of Big Red One a little bit
It looks like they spent their three years making this trailer instead of the actual game itself
Much better than the multi for sure
Why american soldier hide his dogtag when captured and being POW by german army?
It would be cool if they have a cameo with the squad from Cod 2 Big Red One, still remember Brooklyn's death
Bad. Your ideas get lost...
The graphics it's just beautiful
YOU HAVE EARNED MY SUBSCRIPTION
Where's my boy Tank Dempsey?\n\n\n\nit's a joke
Too bad the in game graphics won't be nearly as good as this😂😂
Finally! See Activision, this is all we wanted!
Wow looks amazing!! Hope there's a D-Day mission
I'm so happy has this is amazing
It has come full circle now
I can't wait to play it.  Looks good.
Are they gonna hire Matt Damon for this mov-- I mean game?
My cousin Mike helped build this game, he said they used mostly copper wire and tape for the graphics. Can't wait to see it play out.
This is going to be good
These are men, OUR MEN! When did you forget?
This is the call of duty that we need. It brings back the memories of the game that people will enjoy to play
Since they're arm most likely banned from using the SS lightning bolts as a symbol in this game, but they were still able to find a way to show the guy at 1:10 is SS. Being interested in history, specifically WW2 you can see that an eagle on the left arm was part of the SS uniform asides from the lightning bolts.
*pause at ****2:02* im buying this game now
There is no such thing as a good call of duty campaign.
BUT WILL THESE GRAPHICS BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE GAMEPLAY!?! :/
Sledgehammer please do not mess this up
Meine Ehre heißt Treue,Only a handful of the people in this comment section will unterstand the significance of this phrase. This game looks amazing congrats to Sledgehammer I think they're going to hit the spot of what is a great Call of Duty, but unfortunately I believe this generation who have been force-fed since their earliest years a narrow one sided view of this war will never truly understand what this war was like for the Germans or even the Axis countries in general, and the everlasting effect it has had on its people. As they say History is written by the victors... Just my 2 cents
The community will find a way to complain, don't worry.
World at war has been my favorite campaign lets seen if this can beat it
Looking forward to the campaign
2:02 THE SWASTICAS ARE BACK
Only thing cod is good at the story
Ready For World War 2!
Why does that German at 1:13 look like thefatrat's face?
Okay, they added Swastikas. For all the people who were complaining that there are none, you can shut up now.
Walther P38 instead of Luger P08 but never mind...
It looks like a movie my gawd
Dont give a damn about multiplayer, this is what I wanted
Bad thing is the actual game won’t look like this
0:29 That is Kingpin from Advanced warfare campaign.
is this a gamo or a fuckung movie lol no hate i like it so buy WWII
I sense a Battle of the Bulge scenario.
This looks so good but I hope they put time in other modes as well unlike infinity ward with infinite warfare
Better have the intervention in this one
I thought there weren't gonna be swastikas?
Looks like a live action movie
Well this is what we waited for.
I would love it if their story is gonna work like a single story in battlefield 1, like where there isnt constant fighting and theres parts where you have to move slow and be quiet and they don't hold your hand through it like they have done so much recently
.......this is the future of gaming......
More American crap, you guys realise the war started before 1941...
Infinite warfare is still better
Looks good, just kinda wish you could play as the good guys.
1:00 we thought we knew what war would be like... but nothing prepared us for this Actvision's reaction to historical inaccuracy hate
This looks like a movie!
How come every cod trailer that comes out i always end up watching it over and over
Is this a game or a movie, I can't tell
dday for the first time in 12 years...
Please keep in mind these arent ingame graphics. This is a cinematic short, these are typically always much more fleshed out. The game itself isn't anything special.
Americans didn’t do everything \nIt was the Soviets
If you look at 2:01\nYou know we're getting a hell of a good campaign
who else is looking forward for this game to drop or is it just me
1:59 now that's just badass.
I hope we get to see Adolf Hitler in this
SWASTIKAS! 2:02
Same old
Good Good
This looks really good
What story?
Swastikas confirmed
This looks dope as hell
Looks awesome
2:01 pause waw , feel like watching BoB ....
I STILL CANT BELIVE ITS NOT BUTTER
Soviet history?
Hi
FINALLY THEY LISTENED
Another hyped up preview
TIIIIIIGGEEERRR TAAAAAAAANNK!!!
I just had siezur
aka bf 1
Nope
1980
Looks really good
finally... we have SWASTIKAS
SWASTIKAS! YES!
#RIPBF1
It lit
Bungie plus Activision equals golden COD egg 😂😂
Graphics are amazing
Finally caught on
Saving Private Ryan: The Game
2:06 RIP BATTLEFIELD 1
Love how every German looks horribly evil and not normal men and boys trying to survive
Why did they do this instead of the pacific front or at least the African front I'm not saying this is bad oh no just the western front is over used.
Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
on my console it dont work :(
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
I can’t get it to work. Help?
I'm tearing up right here, legit
WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy

This is fucking beautiful.

I really gotta learn sign language.
岩田「直接！」\n(iwata) (Choku setsu !)
Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
It doesnt work
Faked for views
Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.
This isn't working for me...
i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
I'm not a fan of mute videos.
did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.
Someone buy this buy a better camera.

Goat fire brigade'  helps save Spain from forest fires\nhttps://youtu.be/ImFJAw2SnZg
I understood how the 3ds had all types of hidden games, but why would Nintendo make you summon a game?
Holy moly can you speak or not?
Cool video paying your respects to him. 👍
i used to rock this game on my nes
Hey that's some pretty good asmr
thank you for posting this.
I did the exact same thing and yet i didnt get it
May I put forward a proposition; you shout me out, and I reciprocate (Do the same)
check.  out.    watch.     now.   \nshared.    my.      video.    2017.
Oh man, I remember that game.
I don't say this often for actions made by people, but this is beautiful...
This is on trending
So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.

Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.

This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
You get a B+ as a mime.
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?

Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
I can’t get it to work. Help?
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
donget it, you just wave your hands around and the game starts?
I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer
does this work for july 11 2018?
is it possible to do this without hacking your switch?
Oh yeah reaaaall cool guy,  😑
fake
on my console it dont work :(
Get a pc
How did someone figure all of this out?
i cant get it to work XP
This isn't working for me...
I just got a switch and cant get it to launch...brand new but it wont launch
Wow, how did this pass 7/11/2017?
Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.

It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
*Summoning Iwata's ghost intensifies*

Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')
How the fuck did you figure that out??

So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.

Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(

WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons

岩田「直接！」\n(iwata) (Choku setsu !)
Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
It doesnt work

Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.

i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know

did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.

Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I really gotta learn sign language.
*Summoning Iwata's ghost intensifies*
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')
How the fuck did you figure that out??

I understood how the 3ds had all types of hidden games, but why would Nintendo make you summon a game?
Holy moly can you speak or not?
Cool video paying your respects to him. 👍
i used to rock this game on my nes
Hey that's some pretty good asmr
thank you for posting this.
I did the exact same thing and yet i didnt get it
May I put forward a proposition; you shout me out, and I reciprocate (Do the same)
check.  out.    watch.     now.   \nshared.    my.      video.    2017.
Oh man, I remember that game.
I don't say this often for actions made by people, but this is beautiful...
This is on trending
So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
You get a B+ as a mime.
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?

I wanna see Etika play this on stream
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
I can’t get it to work. Help?
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
donget it, you just wave your hands around and the game starts?
I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer
does this work for july 11 2018?
is it possible to do this without hacking your switch?
Oh yeah reaaaall cool guy,  😑
fake
on my console it dont work :(

How did someone figure all of this out?
i cant get it to work XP
This isn't working for me...
I just got a switch and cant get it to launch...brand new but it wont launch
Wow, how did this pass 7/11/2017?
Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.
Are you supposed to press any of the top shoulder buttons when you do this?

That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.

Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(

I'm tearing up right here, legit
WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons

Only Nintendo...
Please understand.
This is fucking beautiful.
RIP Satoru Iwata
I really gotta learn sign language.

Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
It doesnt work
Faked for views
Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.
This isn't working for me...
i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
I'm not a fan of mute videos.
did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.
Someone buy this buy a better camera.
Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I really gotta learn sign language.
*Summoning Iwata's ghost intensifies*
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')
How the fuck did you figure that out??

I understood how the 3ds had all types of hidden games, but why would Nintendo make you summon a game?
Holy moly can you speak or not?
Cool video paying your respects to him. 👍
i used to rock this game on my nes
Hey that's some pretty good asmr
thank you for posting this.
I did the exact same thing and yet i didnt get it
May I put forward a proposition; you shout me out, and I reciprocate (Do the same)
check.  out.    watch.     now.   \nshared.    my.      video.    2017.
Oh man, I remember that game.
I don't say this often for actions made by people, but this is beautiful...
This is on trending
So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
You get a B+ as a mime.
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?

Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
I can’t get it to work. Help?
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
donget it, you just wave your hands around and the game starts?
I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer
does this work for july 11 2018?
is it possible to do this without hacking your switch?
Oh yeah reaaaall cool guy,  😑
fake
on my console it dont work :(
Get a pc
How did someone figure all of this out?
i cant get it to work XP
This isn't working for me...
I just got a switch and cant get it to launch...brand new but it wont launch
Wow, how did this pass 7/11/2017?
Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.
Are you supposed to press any of the top shoulder buttons when you do this?
Iwata almost ran Nintendo into the fucking ground

That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.

In this new island they should not reward rushing. It gives the other person a huge advantage in attack. Instead they should make it so there are leagues for each builder hall lvl. I cannot tell you the amount of times I did well on a bh6 just to find out I get 3 starred by max leveled witches. In conclusion, they should reward players for taking there time with there base and have them face off against each other.

Best in the world 👍👍👍👍👍👍
People still play this? It died early 2015
hi supercell! we are glad to see that supercell. has been giving many updates. I am also feeling well that supercell had released builder hall level 7 ,but I want to convey to you that, it's to boring to attack only using by our troops at builder hall. I want to say to you just, we want spells at builder hall so,  please supercell accept our request, and. think something about my sayings.
At 0:13 is that builder hall 8
Nice its all we are waiting for
This video is awesome and misleading. It's for builderhall level 8. At start of video you see 2 Guard Posts. At some point mid video we see level 8 Crusher and level 8 Firecrackers too.
Add a second builder!! It takes to long with just one
I hope they fix the matchmaking. I don’t want to be paired against bh7 as a bh6. Ima get recked every time. And I hate rushing
what about main village we stuck in 11 for ages
I like it ... sub
Where is the main village update supercell.. Getting bored with the main village.. CLASH ON ✌️✌️
Important update we cant have fun in bh base if we dont have friendly battles add it please,  also balance the match up we hate matching with max troops its annoying
You can find builder hall 8 and its upgrades in the vid
Plz help me my 511 gems has disappeared how no one used it
I'm only one builder hall 2. These money grabbing whores made it so u can only have one builder wtf.
Just a game within a game. No biggie.
I'm so hyped for bh 7
Haven’t played in forever too many micro transactions to actually progress in the game
i want to play clash of c;lan

0:10 GG Supercell you ban for leaking updates and stuff, and you're leaking  all the BH8 :v
If it comes so how can it look
Wow !!!! I just want to say this much
Dear supercell this player #88CROJYJY using bad words in our family clan. Plz block this person. His acount name is $h!$h!r. He always write bad words in clan joining rqst box and when we accept to warn him he leave certainly. We can not do anything. Our family members have to ready all bad words. Which is abusive.
Oh look it's on trending
Dont fall for this trap.. The game is designed to get you to spend money.. U will never max your Builder hall base without gems. And you will always face opponents with better defenses.. This is psychological warfare. I have a max townhall 11 and they wont even give me more walls to update.. supercell only cares about one thing and that is maximizing profits.. They employ psychologists to help design the game to be addictive. They target the Reward Zone of your brain. This is why u get upset when u lose and your first thought is.. Wish I had some gems. Everyone should boycott the builder base.  Those guys at the top with gemmed bases are givwn gems by supercell. Notice how they cater to the youtubers because they have 10,000 gem spending spree videos.. They are paid in gems to get you to buy gems.. This game was fun. Now its just a money pit.. Shame on you supercell
Love clash royal da best 😀😀 all so mincraft and Roblox yaa Yt to😀😀😀😏😏😄🤗🤗😄😄😏😍😜😍😘😘😘😬😬😬😬😆😆😁😬😀😄😄😄😀

Omg i thought that pewdiepie was most subbed but Clearly not!! 77mill!!!!
AdSense communities: should we give most of our ads to pewdiepie or music.     \nHead of the community: nah give it to clash of clans their videos always go trending
This is an understatement: You're fucking incredible.
Well done! As an ex-NS developer, that was a cool trip down memory lane. :) Funny to see how many Skater references shipped in GH3!
This guy sounds exactly like Napoleon Dynamite
fixes 10 year old bug for a huge community\ncommunity switches to a new game\nrip
Exactly like complex GTA mods are made :)\nIt's really hard to do. Respect.
Hi, just a quick Q: Was the CScreenElement names etc. part of the binary code? Or did you add them manually as part of disassembly?
As a programmer who hasn't ever had to work at the assembly level (and hasn't even used a C-level language in well over a decade), I applaud you for explaining this well enough for me to follow along!
Couldn't the text object pool be refreshed like, I don't know, whenever one starts and finishes (or quits) a song? Or better yet, force a refresh in an idle cycle or something?\nEither way, yeah, that is pretty damn sweet.
i'd really like all the plugins and ..everything you have in ida. and gosh, that dark style is so much nicer to the eyes than the default Q_Q
An absolute joy to see those skills!
Is there a reason as to why this only happens on PC and not console?
this is actually on trending!
Oh my god this is so amazing. <3\nA huge kudos for you bro!
Even though Clone Hero's rise in popularity has caused bug fixes like these to become less monumental, the work you do is still incredible. Especially when you have to get around DRM. Fuck DRM.
Jeez this video could get you a job! Finding bugs after de-obfuscating code!
More videos like these! They're awesome :D
You got a sub from me your video was absolutely amazing!
The main take I got out of this is that fixing bugs without the source code is a pain in the ass. And for that I commend your dedication!
well, I guess that isn't truely fixing the bug? tho it would take a lot of effort to import 32767 songs and get a score on each one
All hail this Legend of Code
You sir are a boss!
Dude, you're a wizard!
That was so fucking intesting, I'd love to see more of this reversr engineering videos.
You just got a new subscriber, very well done.
I have a question.  What?
Awesome presentation. You rock!
great video. Keep it up. It's AMAZING!!!!
What is a guitar hero send help
Young software dev here..this was amazing. Absolutely thank you, and keep up the holy work.
lol your enthusiasm about unfettered is entertaining. also you sort of sound like Paul Miller of The Verge
Exile! Please tell me where you got potato-head in Wonderland by Utsu-P! I saw it in your setlist when I paused and I NEED it! Pleeease.
I should go burn my CS degree rn. Entertaining stuff!
This is incredibly cool. I always wanted to learn a bit more about debugging and maybe fixing games but I don't even know where to start.
Also are you planning on doing another video on the crash after 260 songs? I would love to see more videos of you debugging these kind of issues and explaining the thought process.
Excellent explanation and editing! Indeed, that's an usual day when modding/fixing GTA ;)
This is so fun to watch, love it!
I'm barely literate when it comes to code, It just eternally eludes me but this video was entertaining and informative as fuck! \nAmazing stuff.
mind boggling\n\ndo you do this for a living for just a hobby?
You are our Demigod of the GH3! :D This really looked interesting btw.
this should be a series
are you Scott Allen ?
Never was interested in my learning assembly in college and my professors didn't make it interesting but this video right here is fantastic! I love GH and you are an incredible dev!
That was so fucking cool
i hope to one day be half as good of a programmer as you
you fucking legend. I annoyingly requested this pretty much any time I requested anything to you, and I apologize. But now it has been done and my heart may find peace. Thank you ExileLord
That was really fun to watch!
This is more interesting than a Vsauce video, keep up the good work Exile!
That was sick and very impressive
Vektor is probably a fucking nightmare to play on expert.
You know, it'd be really neat if you made more videos like this. Even tutorials for the programs you use would be really awesome.\n\nt. computer engineering major

I love that Amalgamation remix. No wonder why it's your favourite song.
Doing god's work comrade, keep it up
I don't know about reverse engineering software but those are some amazing video editing skills! :-)
Here, take my like. Thank you!
This is the best video on reverse engineering I ever watched - great job!
Awesome video, crazy amount of work put into this.
Thank you for everything - Exile. We all love you, I mean it. <3
260, which is 255 + 5... another bug! :D
Some seriously impressive reverse engineering of the assembly code!
You are a fucking genius
You are the Guitar Hero.
Is that amalgamation 2 in the outro!?
this video is amazing. you should make more coding videos
the bug was _exiled_
Around 260 songs? Array pointer overflow at 255/256 maybe?
The best :3
Great video!
You're like Neo.. holy crap
Nice work!
This is amazing.
Thank...Fucking...GOD
Great video thank you
Awesome video. More code & reverse engineering videos pls

Did the developers really think that no one would exceed the 375 text \ninstances? I'm just shocked that they wouldn't check to see if the pool \nwas fully depleted. You also mention that the score itself uses a text \ninstance. So with 260 songs causing the crash, how many had the score \nbeside it? In other words how many text instances before it crashed?\n\nOh and nice job, really informative and loved the video!!
This was so informative, thank you. I've always wondered what it was like to work the code of an allready compiled game. I never considered that they would put preventative measures into it to stop you. Impressive how you figured out a way around it anyway.
That was really awesome. Where did you get your knowledge of x86 assembly and reverse engineering?
Very informative, do you plan to  fix the bug ?
The destructors basically like the destructions basically like something that destroys destroying other things reverse memory and restore it
I expected a different Megapeng channel honestly from what you linked...
Not that your work isn't noted, but Clone Hero is a thing, which virtually makes this a pointless journey. :/
You're the best!\n\nIs there a reason there aren't simple scripts to get past Securom's obfusicating? If it's always the same pattern like you described, why can't you just have something go through the data and get rid of extra functions and the like?

This is microtransactions incarnate. Fuck you, EA. Oh, and fuck you too, Disney. Can I use mind trick in this game even if I don't wtf mind trick is? Because Mary Sue Rey could.
It's a shame they had to release the entire first game + 4 or more DLC before they realised the game was a shambles. It shows they knew exactly what to do, just chose not to until now.
This a great improvement over BF1 but the microtransactions/star cards have no place in a full priced game and still no Galactic Conquest. I'll wait for the reviews.
I am not buying this game till I can play as Episode 3 Anakin. You decide how soon that'll be, EA.
Still don't see any Droidekas! The one thing I was looking forward to playing as.....Dam it.
I PRESUME ORDER IT HYPE HYPE HYYYYYYYYPE WAIT IT'S not here HOLD ON ONLY 3 DAYS EARLY ACCESS UGHHH LAME
soo... you mean to say you actually tried this time
I love how it's literally a marketing point to show how shitty the first one is over this one.
OH MYYYYY HOW MANY DLC IS IN THAT GAME
now this is what they should've done with the first one to begin with, well done EA, now to see the catch
This is ... another shitty EA game
Is there no walker assault?? That would suck
Wait..so you're tellin me... They finally listened to us??
Looks like Star fighter mode is separate from being on the ground
Man! That was so well explained and showcased. I am pretty much sold on this :) It looks fucking amazing !
This is getting out of hand. Where ARE those droidekas??
This is honestly a pretty good marketing trailer. I'm not even that hyped for the game and it kind of made me excited.
This is where the fun begins.
Fuck it I'm robbing wal Mart for this shit the hype just made my balls explode
Man y’all should really add “bring cargo” again. That was my favorite game mode on the last battle front game
Star Wars Battlefront EA II. Don't forget you put EA in the title :P
Rey is gonna be the Luke Skywalker from Battlefront I. Except she looks more like a faggot
I see a pay to play. 👀
where is geonsis bf2 is missing best map
It's looks amazing but how dare they say that this is a Star Wars experience like none other. I think you're forgetting about another Star Wars battlefront 2.
I've got a baaad feeling about this. Heroes not locked to their eras will be so off putting, Star cards will ruin balance and the re-skinned Battlefield game modes will tire out quickly. Repeating the same mistakes as Battlefront minus the random weapon pickups. I guess we will never see the old leaked gameplay of Battlefront III come to life. 6/10 for being pretty and unique sp story but uninspired gameplay, imo of course
Hopefully split screen 2plyr online modes as well
4:04 - The new Resistance A-wing! :O\n\nI sure hope they don't let us down with this new Arcade mode. I'm concerned they've focused too much on providing a cinematic single player campaign and not enough on an improved instant action mode like Skirmish was in the last game. That had so much potential and it went to waste. I'm going to be really bummed if Arcade turns out to be an improved version of Missions. An improved instant action mode that supports all maps, modes and a greatly enhanced AI should take priority over a single player campaign.
I'm not gonna bother pre ordering after the first one. enjoyed it but too many annoying features. Wana see how the reviews play out before spending any cash
WHERE IS JAR JAR?!? I need him!
Create Star Wars for VR and then I’ll be impressed
lol just remake the old game with better graphics and customizable weapons. it would sell like crazy
Please change the name so the original battlefront games dont have to be related to this pile of shit.
Why not all games are built like this? It has Beautiful graphics, Can easily run 60fps even in 4k and large multiplayer support, and even Doom and Wolfenstein can pull of such Graphics
How do I get accesses to the beta on the fourth as I pre orderd the game o n disc
This is a good year for gaming, fans are getting what they want for every game. CoD WW2 is boots on the ground and Star Wars BF2 is looking amazing and better than the last one, i’ve missed some games but these two will probably will be the best sellers
I bet this shit won't have Anakin or the Jedi Temple :/
Hm... okay... interesting... wait a tic... WHERE TF IS WALKER ASSAULT??!!?!?!
It seems like they’re heading in the right direction like the old battlefront games.
It would be cool if they had a game mode that was always going, like in planetside, and you fight for territory and at the end of like a week the faction with the most territory get rewarded
What you can play in splitscreen only arcade or more?
But... in these space modes will I be able to board fighters of my choice and fight in starships as well as dogfight in space like in the original SWBF2 (Rest in Peace)?
Well this fixes almost all my complaints about the first one.
John Boyega 2017: Finn will be there of course
The Season Pass for Star Wars Battlefront 1 is free right now for PS4
People are so stupid. 90% of the people out there bitchin and moaning about EVERYTHING. It actually looks like they put the time into this one because the first one was way too simplistic. Everyone seriously needs to take a breath and relax. As soon as people get something they want, they will just bitch about something else.
To address a lot of peoples concerns:\nThis game does have micro transactions in the sense you spend money to get crates with a chance of giving you better start cards. Better star cards means lower cool down and other minor differences. You can still earn these cards by playing the game. It's no different than Battlefield's battle packs or Overwatch's loot crates. Also all the DLC's are free and you will not be required to buy anything more than just the base game. People need to quit complaining and appreciate the fact that the devs have done so much more this time around. They delivered on most things people asked for and yet people continue to find something else to cry about. How about appreciating the fact we get free DLC's and much more.
The first part looked like an uncharted scene
Basically the game we should have gotten in 2015..
Doesnt have galactic conquest. Not worth it.
If there's no garlic bread I'm not interested.
Looks incredible, to bad they did the same boring loot box shit honestly just let people level up for stuff.
Jesus looks so real and amazing omg I can't wait!!!!
Game looks awesome but I'm a little disappoint at only 5 game modes but we'll see how fun the new ones are!
20v20?\nThat's it?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
They had better deliver.
Nice game
I keep watching this Lol
MINDBLOWNINEEDTHIS
Yay. Pay to win mechanics.
Huh all this yet no galatic conquest?
REMEMBER NO PREORDERS!!!
Camino! Thank God.
Boyega is a cuck
Need new undies.... worth it
we need general grevious!!!!!
For the republic!
Looks epic !
Almost as good as battefront 1
Only 20 v 20?\n\nHmm, not sure. :(
pleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuck
HOLY FUCK! This gave me goosebumps...
Is that John Boyega?
Insecure of Paragon much?
20 versus 20 wtf ???
Lite
MORE OFFLINE MODES PLEASE
Waiting for the downgrade
0:48 made me cringe so hard.....
Dat blue milk money
Watch those wrist rockets
4:07 Watch those wrist rockets!
Woah woah woah only five game modes?!
At 2:28 I seen Chewy!!!
2:58 lol rip Kylo
No Droidekas as playable characters??? :( Or are they going to be star-card weapons (if they Actually appear in the game)?
Will I be in the game?
02:26 Chewy stands on a nail 🤔
Still praying for galactic conquest :(
Star Wars: Battlefront III\n2015\nStop lying EA
Fuel been l's chi PC ebb crash cash l's penis hurt when touch inside did cut Mhz Nippon khan oz Rica site basis also pal pillion Philadelphia Mcdonald's stoical medics dud
I am really looking forward to be playing as darth maul and Kylo ren
This looks absolutely amazing. But honestly, I think the game would benefit if it didn't include cross Era heroes in galactic assault and starfighter assault. It really takes away from the immersion when you see Rey killing battle droids. Star Wars fans crave authenticity.
It looks pretty awesome! Just like my UCS Millennium Falcon Time Lapse Build!!!! https://youtu.be/3AO6zDEzHzo
This video is basically \n\nDICE: GUYS WE'RE SORRY !
This is star wars battlefront 2: *the same as swbf1 but now with the season pass included, which is how swbf1 should've been.*\n\nI mean cmn this games nothing special
I want this game NOW
Only 5 game modes :( last one had like ten and that was the best part about that game.
star fighter assault for the republic
I don't know if I should be excited to see you,or not @jon boyega (don't know if this is how you spell it). I just haven't seen enough of you.....
This gonna be 1st game i used money to bought it
Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen heroes. Secret power: Burn up, where your hero catches on fire and burns to a crisp. EXTRA POINTS FOR IF YOU ACTIVATE THIS POWER INFRONT OF ANAKIN OR LUKE SKYWALKER!!!!!! It introduces new buff: Traumatize!
This is GOTY (hopefully).\nZelda fanboys pls, if BOTW comes out with free dlc(s). OK I get it. I really didn't see the appeal for BOTW the game looked quite boring.
GoW4, Battlefront, and *Red fucking Dead 2*! My PS4 is finally going to have a purpose. I bought this shit this year and so far it's a fucking decor.
0:16 Finn, Star Wars THE LAST JEDI\ndid they lose their minds?
So...we will not have 32 vs 32 on Battlefront II ? like Battlefield?
Most of these 14 characters and some maps will be reused ones from previous games. smh. Anyone who preorders this, have fun with your rehashed game.
still 20 v 20 ugh. what ever looks way better than the first bf
EA, Star Wars, Disney... the ultimate combo in controlling consumer sheep.
I am like Fin
I just wish they didn't include any Disney stuff in a Star Wars game
I'm so amped up
why the fuck is everyone praising this shit, no galactic conquest no boarding ships its the same fucking shit except with a damn story mode im mad af
20 vs 20 ...that is pathetic..by now I would expect at least 150 vs 150....
**Who else thinks star wars battlefront 2 should include customized battle sequences from epic scenes from the movies and make game modes around that.. even if maybe some heroes or characters wouldn't fit the plot story or lore I think it would be an amazing thing.. \n\nImagine having to stop the invasion of the clones or saving Naboo from the droids or the attack on that place in episode one with Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi... I bet millions of die hard fans would love to reenact the famous Darth Maul scene with Liam Neeson and Swan McGregor.\n\nHell I bet many would love to play the epic scene involving the destruction of the first death star. \n\nMake it happen EA.\n\n MAKE STAR WARS GAMES GREAT AGAIN!**
looks awesome the Yavin IV map seems like the Yavin temples of jedi knight saga I love it
Can you play it on EA Access?
Looks great, but all i want is the normal conquest mode like in the old battlefront games.
Cant wait to get my ps4
Like this so EA can see it\nHero List:\nAshoka, Anakin,Obi Wan, General Grevious, Mace Windu, Dooku, Padme, Jango Phett & Captain Rex! Please EA get these characters in the game!:)
Just me who loved that John Byoga talked over everything
Oh C’mon now i want to play this EEEEEEEEVEN more>:(
All I want is space battles and land battles going on at the same time that can be seamlessly transitioned between. I know, I know never gonna happen... but I don't care.
Anyone else see Luke just make Kylo look like an absolute bitch with the force?
Ik it's john boyega but is it sad that at first I thought it was KSI?
I like it more than other!
Is their even any point to play the first Battlefront anymore!? Lol seriously
This looks like a improved version of star wars battlefront 2 the original. So im pretty impressee
RELEASE THE DAMN GAME BEFORE I PISS MESELF
Woah it seems so cool I'm gonna get it once I get the money!
Thanks to star cards, new players are still at a disadvantage against players that have earned lots of star cards. \n\nAlso, because of the battle point system, players that are not particularly good will not be able to play the game the way they want. They won't be able to easily attain vehicles or characters they wish to use, which may ultimately ruin their gameplay experience.\n\nAlso still no capital ship to capital ship combat like in Pandemic's Battlefront 2.\n\nCome on DICE, all you had to do was give the fans what they want, an update to Pandemic's battlefront games with conquest mode and ground to space combat, including capital ships.
can't tell from the trailer if the maps are painfully linear\n\nalso, if there are no bots, it's not worth getting. bots are great filler and act as fodder while doing objectives. it's what kept the real battlefront alive for so long.
I'm hesitant, especially with all this star cards battle points parts nonsense, my microtransaction senses are tingling. \n\nThey're using the name, they've got even bigger shoes to fill.
Finally they basically made it Battlefront but Battlefield style.
Can you say \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP A Y 2 W I N\nThanks EA, fuck you
I’ll still wait to buy. Not going to pre order. Looks dope but I’m no fool.
I'd rather have a reskinned and remastered battlefield with some space incorporated into it. The Vehicle spawning still triggers me at most lol
You should give away for free this game to all of the brave souls like me who bought your first shit! That would be a good apology
Is splitscreen arcade playing the multiplayer modes with bots or is it like a wave survival? And are we able to play the multiplayer modes splitscreen offline?
All soldiers of the Empire....\nThe Rebellion has thrown the Galaxy into chaos. It has taken from us Order! Stability! The very peace they claim to fight for has been shattered by their treason. And worst of all....they have taken our Emperor! But Fear not, brave sons and daughters of our great Empire, for the war has just begun. The Rebel dogs think us beaten, and even now celebrate their victory. We shall show them that such celebrations are foolishly naive. Remember why we fight.  Fight for those who are in your thoughts! Fight so that your families may know Order and Stability rather than Chaos and Anarchy! Fight to avenge our fallen, those brave souls now at rest. Fight for every trooper beside you, your brothers in arms! Do not count the days, do not count the Parsecs, count only the number of Rebels you have killed! This is the cry of your Empire! Death to the Rebellion!
would be cool if you could chose whether you want to force push or force pull doesn't need to be in the game just something cool that i would like added
will all the  heroes and maps from the first game be returning in battlefront 2?
Ok, but if you don't have era specific heros, it's gonna be kinda weird and stupid
If those crates mean micro transactions then I'm going to flip the fuck out
I want to see Gangnam Style and gentleman as an emote
* just bought star wars battlefront and then sees this *\n\nU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!!?
I wish I could play this game - I only have Nintendo consoles, and I'm not interested in buying a PS4 for the one game I would want on it.  I would buy this game on Switch in a heartbeat.  And don't tell me it won't run - if games like Doom 2016 and Wolfenstein 2 are coming to Switch, please don't tell me it can't happen.  I am thankful you're bringing FIFA, but I'm not going to buy it - I'm not into sports games.  Never have been.  Give me Star Wars.
These (allmost) 5 minutes felt like an hour of fun!!!
This is one of the Best vid i've Steen in my life
Now this... this looks good.
Lol he says 20v20 like it's a big deal
The time has come.\n\nExecute Pre-order 66.
Охренеть! !  Разделенный экран^ куплю обязательно!.

4:16 Yoda would absolutely dick on Maul.
Fucking CRATES!!!
Me gusta star wars batterfront 2
A i tak wyjdzie z tego kupa.
Will this game run on my pc ?\nPentium G4400 \nMOBO MSI PRO-D\nGTX 1050 \n8 gb ram\nI just want to play this without crashes. I don't care about graphics
Font colour yellow, brackets need to be rewritten to format
Very good and nice
It looked pretty interesting until you can find them in crates ...mmkay seeya next time EA
I love John Boyega’s voice
Why is not Rex or Fives in the game😭
What u should know about Darth Vader, funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlYNwEWAUoU
What happened to all the game modes on the first one? They should have carried them over as well
the sound design of the shooting, explosions and hits are amazing
who tf is gonna choose rei over maul
Basically a remastered version of the original star Wars battle field 1 which instead of coming out with the newer bf1 they shoulda just came out with this
i almost died when i saw that content!!
I didn't think that i would say this, but this actually looks amazing!
So cross hero gameplay is a thing :/
I want to know if Matt the Radar Technician be added to the game at some point.
I was so happy to hear the game mode galactic assault and then they said 20vs20.\nWhere is the old version where you could split screen, choose between the empire or republic and duke it out across the universe taking planets and destroying your friends fleet in space...\nplayers of the originals will understand what I mean, although there is more content here I really hope that EA could throw this game mode back in.
Game could be good but it isn't! Same shitty system like the first one and like bf one as well! Why could EA not saty with the old battlefront? Or like bf3?
This is Star Wars Battlefront Two, where we give you features the originals had ten years ago and pretend we're being innovative
Boy the compression took a hit LMFAO
People talking about “free dlc”.... you forgot they’re adding micro transactions to make up for that money?
Ps4 footage my ass. The particles and textures are beyond ps4 can handle. I doubt this will even match final version.
Bet your tits I'm playin heros vs villains all day everyday
EA......... this looks pretty badass so far.......... SO PLEASE DON'T FUCK THIS UP AND MAKE IT A GREEDY DLC FEST LIKE THE LAST GAME.
The pay to win is strong in you young Battlefront 2...
So fucking hot I'm excited
Kylo ren...  i honestly think they screwed up the whole entire series adding him
I'm trying not to get my hopes up lol
I know I wasn’t the only one that had GOOSE bumps
I don't think enough people are talking about how Heros and Ships and stuff are not randomly places on the map now. The better you play the more youll be a hero, which is how it SHOULD be.
EA should've added Tr-8r as a hero character
Every time obi wan spawns he better be saying Hello there or this game fails
Why not galactic conquest smh that was am amazing part of the old ones, bring it back!
I was so happy watching this, then they mentioned loot boxes. Then I remembered this is EA.
Can you play the single player campaign with a friend?
This video just convinced me to pre order this game. Where are my pants? Lol 😂
There are levels of rarity in star cards - Ayy my favorite
EA, I can almost hear Bakers voice as the clones. EA, why not Morris? EA?! IS IT BAKER OR MORRIS?!!
This game shouldn't be getting hate, because they fixed everything and listened to their fans. This game looks EPIC!!! Definitely buying... when the price goes down a bit ( probably after a month or two XD ) But i definitely recommend you buy this game!!!
No matter how good this game is, some people will hate it just because it’s EA.
This made my nuts wet.
When EA wanna bump up the hype train but you don't wanna get dissapointed yet:\n\nI'm one with the force and the force is with me, I'm one with the force and the force is with me, I'm one with the force and the force is with me.....
They better of gotten rid of that bitch ass shield that completely destroyed the fun out of the first one. you'd be seconds away from killing someone and that motherfucker would activate that shield and run off into the sunset as you get killed trying to claim that kill.
Will it be on Steam?
I want to take Yoda, my favourite character
Good but until lightsaber combat gets better than what they showed us I ain't buying
new star wars mmo with these graphics <3 <3
I swear if they don't nerf the Scattergun
Political Correctness shit plus the space fights looks like the planes are all just gliding too damn slow.
There is no R2B2 engaged in assisting the battle, this isn't worth playing.
Cant wait to play this\nI hope EA makes this the battlefront game we all can enjoy and get so much satisfaction from.\n\n really have high hopes for this
instead of finn we could have anakin for the force sake
Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005) still looks and will be vastly better. Fucking lol. 14 maps.\n\n\n\n*1 4*\n\n\n\n*L o l*\n\nInstant action?\n*No.*\nGalactic conquest?\n*No.*\nMods?\n*No.*\nSingle player campaign that's actually likeable and not cookie cutter?\n*No.*\nGood game? \n*You bet your ass not.*
Let me guess... DLC...More DLC...Mirco-Transactions... Even More Mirco-Tranactions...spending $150 for an incomplete game that requires me to purchase DLC.... I doubt this BattleFront 2 will beat the Original...
Damn, this game looks crisp. It brings new life into Star Wars
There are so many Sith and Jedi from the expanded universe you could add in the game and you edgy phase Kylo ren
Can people who bought Battle Front 1 please get a discount or some reward for buying this one?
but CAN you get IN and OUT of the vehicles? and transport friends in 2 person ships?
Love This game I played The first one Amazing.. BUT IT'S MISSING a few things that would take this game to the next level.  LIKE CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION AND It Would be nice to be able to keep your level from SWB Pt. 1 AND EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO LEVEL UP AND BECOME A BOUNTY HUNTER, JEDI OR SITH WITH YOUR CHARACTER JUST SAYIN.
We've captured the command post! That's all I want to hear
Right, but how does this compare to Star Wars Battlefront 2?\n\nThat's the question everyone really wants answered.
EA u call this a game?!?\n\n\n\n\n\nI call it a masterpiece
Looks absolutely amazing!!\nIm speechless!!!!! \n(Like if u agree)!
2:29 You just cant have nice things
Finally a game where they focus on the villains and not the good guys even tho I think the dark side is way better than the light side who agrees
Nothing pisses me off in these kinds of comments sections then 10 year old's bragging about how they and all their friends pre-ordered the most expensive edition.  They are constantly disappointed by horrible games, but they never stop.
Quick question, do Banthas count as vehicles?
Wow
And singleplayer hah?
WE NEED MORE
p2w?
This is unrealistic but I want the following heroes after DLC...\nAnakin\nObi-wan\nPadme\nMace Windu\nYoda\nAhsoka\nCaptain Rex\nDarth Maul\nCount Dooku\nGeneral Grievous\nJango Fett\nAsajj Ventress\nSavage Opress\nCad Bane\nLuke\nLeia\nHan Solo\nChewbacca\nLando\nNien Nunb\nJyn Erso\nDarth Vader\nPalpatine\nBoba Fett\nGreedo\nBossk\nDengar\nKrennic\nRey\nFinn\nPoe\nKylo Ren\nPhasma\nHux
Wymagania? Jakie sa wymagania!
meh
Throws away cod ww2 disc*

FIX THE BOTS
Cuando aprenden de los errores del pasado
Like si querías que hubiesen mas de 100 unidades en la batalla como antiguamente
Another female protagonist.. For fucks sake.
In this new island they should not reward rushing. It gives the other person a huge advantage in attack. Instead they should make it so there are leagues for each builder hall lvl. I cannot tell you the amount of times I did well on a bh6 just to find out I get 3 starred by max leveled witches. In conclusion, they should reward players for taking there time with there base and have them face off against each other.

Best in the world 👍👍👍👍👍👍
People still play this? It died early 2015
hi supercell! we are glad to see that supercell. has been giving many updates. I am also feeling well that supercell had released builder hall level 7 ,but I want to convey to you that, it's to boring to attack only using by our troops at builder hall. I want to say to you just, we want spells at builder hall so,  please supercell accept our request, and. think something about my sayings.
At 0:13 is that builder hall 8
Nice its all we are waiting for
This video is awesome and misleading. It's for builderhall level 8. At start of video you see 2 Guard Posts. At some point mid video we see level 8 Crusher and level 8 Firecrackers too.
Add a second builder!! It takes to long with just one
I hope they fix the matchmaking. I don’t want to be paired against bh7 as a bh6. Ima get recked every time. And I hate rushing
what about main village we stuck in 11 for ages
I like it ... sub
Where is the main village update supercell.. Getting bored with the main village.. CLASH ON ✌️✌️
Important update we cant have fun in bh base if we dont have friendly battles add it please,  also balance the match up we hate matching with max troops its annoying
You can find builder hall 8 and its upgrades in the vid
Plz help me my 511 gems has disappeared how no one used it
I'm only one builder hall 2. These money grabbing whores made it so u can only have one builder wtf.
Just a game within a game. No biggie.
I'm so hyped for bh 7
Haven’t played in forever too many micro transactions to actually progress in the game
i want to play clash of c;lan

0:10 GG Supercell you ban for leaking updates and stuff, and you're leaking  all the BH8 :v
If it comes so how can it look
Wow !!!! I just want to say this much
Dear supercell this player #88CROJYJY using bad words in our family clan. Plz block this person. His acount name is $h!$h!r. He always write bad words in clan joining rqst box and when we accept to warn him he leave certainly. We can not do anything. Our family members have to ready all bad words. Which is abusive.
Oh look it's on trending
Dont fall for this trap.. The game is designed to get you to spend money.. U will never max your Builder hall base without gems. And you will always face opponents with better defenses.. This is psychological warfare. I have a max townhall 11 and they wont even give me more walls to update.. supercell only cares about one thing and that is maximizing profits.. They employ psychologists to help design the game to be addictive. They target the Reward Zone of your brain. This is why u get upset when u lose and your first thought is.. Wish I had some gems. Everyone should boycott the builder base.  Those guys at the top with gemmed bases are givwn gems by supercell. Notice how they cater to the youtubers because they have 10,000 gem spending spree videos.. They are paid in gems to get you to buy gems.. This game was fun. Now its just a money pit.. Shame on you supercell
Love clash royal da best 😀😀 all so mincraft and Roblox yaa Yt to😀😀😀😏😏😄🤗🤗😄😄😏😍😜😍😘😘😘😬😬😬😬😆😆😁😬😀😄😄😄😀

Omg i thought that pewdiepie was most subbed but Clearly not!! 77mill!!!!
AdSense communities: should we give most of our ads to pewdiepie or music.     \nHead of the community: nah give it to clash of clans their videos always go trending
This is an understatement: You're fucking incredible.
Well done! As an ex-NS developer, that was a cool trip down memory lane. :) Funny to see how many Skater references shipped in GH3!
This guy sounds exactly like Napoleon Dynamite
fixes 10 year old bug for a huge community\ncommunity switches to a new game\nrip
Exactly like complex GTA mods are made :)\nIt's really hard to do. Respect.
Hi, just a quick Q: Was the CScreenElement names etc. part of the binary code? Or did you add them manually as part of disassembly?
As a programmer who hasn't ever had to work at the assembly level (and hasn't even used a C-level language in well over a decade), I applaud you for explaining this well enough for me to follow along!
Couldn't the text object pool be refreshed like, I don't know, whenever one starts and finishes (or quits) a song? Or better yet, force a refresh in an idle cycle or something?\nEither way, yeah, that is pretty damn sweet.
i'd really like all the plugins and ..everything you have in ida. and gosh, that dark style is so much nicer to the eyes than the default Q_Q
An absolute joy to see those skills!
Is there a reason as to why this only happens on PC and not console?
this is actually on trending!
Oh my god this is so amazing. <3\nA huge kudos for you bro!
Even though Clone Hero's rise in popularity has caused bug fixes like these to become less monumental, the work you do is still incredible. Especially when you have to get around DRM. Fuck DRM.
Jeez this video could get you a job! Finding bugs after de-obfuscating code!
More videos like these! They're awesome :D
You got a sub from me your video was absolutely amazing!
The main take I got out of this is that fixing bugs without the source code is a pain in the ass. And for that I commend your dedication!
well, I guess that isn't truely fixing the bug? tho it would take a lot of effort to import 32767 songs and get a score on each one
All hail this Legend of Code
You sir are a boss!
Dude, you're a wizard!
That was so fucking intesting, I'd love to see more of this reversr engineering videos.
You just got a new subscriber, very well done.
I have a question.  What?
Awesome presentation. You rock!
great video. Keep it up. It's AMAZING!!!!
What is a guitar hero send help
Young software dev here..this was amazing. Absolutely thank you, and keep up the holy work.
lol your enthusiasm about unfettered is entertaining. also you sort of sound like Paul Miller of The Verge
Exile! Please tell me where you got potato-head in Wonderland by Utsu-P! I saw it in your setlist when I paused and I NEED it! Pleeease.
I should go burn my CS degree rn. Entertaining stuff!
This is incredibly cool. I always wanted to learn a bit more about debugging and maybe fixing games but I don't even know where to start.
Also are you planning on doing another video on the crash after 260 songs? I would love to see more videos of you debugging these kind of issues and explaining the thought process.
Excellent explanation and editing! Indeed, that's an usual day when modding/fixing GTA ;)
This is so fun to watch, love it!
I'm barely literate when it comes to code, It just eternally eludes me but this video was entertaining and informative as fuck! \nAmazing stuff.
mind boggling\n\ndo you do this for a living for just a hobby?
You are our Demigod of the GH3! :D This really looked interesting btw.
this should be a series
are you Scott Allen ?
Never was interested in my learning assembly in college and my professors didn't make it interesting but this video right here is fantastic! I love GH and you are an incredible dev!
That was so fucking cool
i hope to one day be half as good of a programmer as you
you fucking legend. I annoyingly requested this pretty much any time I requested anything to you, and I apologize. But now it has been done and my heart may find peace. Thank you ExileLord
That was really fun to watch!
This is more interesting than a Vsauce video, keep up the good work Exile!
That was sick and very impressive
Vektor is probably a fucking nightmare to play on expert.
You know, it'd be really neat if you made more videos like this. Even tutorials for the programs you use would be really awesome.\n\nt. computer engineering major
I understood some of those words.
This is incredible, love the video style and the content. You sir have my vote and my sub
I love that Amalgamation remix. No wonder why it's your favourite song.
Doing god's work comrade, keep it up
I don't know about reverse engineering software but those are some amazing video editing skills! :-)
Here, take my like. Thank you!
This is the best video on reverse engineering I ever watched - great job!
Awesome video, crazy amount of work put into this.
Thank you for everything - Exile. We all love you, I mean it. <3
260, which is 255 + 5... another bug! :D
Some seriously impressive reverse engineering of the assembly code!
You are a fucking genius
You are the Guitar Hero.
Is that amalgamation 2 in the outro!?
this video is amazing. you should make more coding videos
the bug was _exiled_
Around 260 songs? Array pointer overflow at 255/256 maybe?
The best :3
Great video!
You're like Neo.. holy crap
Nice work!
This is amazing.
Thank...Fucking...GOD
Great video thank you
Awesome video. More code & reverse engineering videos pls
Nice job.

Did the developers really think that no one would exceed the 375 text \ninstances? I'm just shocked that they wouldn't check to see if the pool \nwas fully depleted. You also mention that the score itself uses a text \ninstance. So with 260 songs causing the crash, how many had the score \nbeside it? In other words how many text instances before it crashed?\n\nOh and nice job, really informative and loved the video!!
This was so informative, thank you. I've always wondered what it was like to work the code of an allready compiled game. I never considered that they would put preventative measures into it to stop you. Impressive how you figured out a way around it anyway.
That was really awesome. Where did you get your knowledge of x86 assembly and reverse engineering?
Very informative, do you plan to  fix the bug ?
The destructors basically like the destructions basically like something that destroys destroying other things reverse memory and restore it
I expected a different Megapeng channel honestly from what you linked...
Not that your work isn't noted, but Clone Hero is a thing, which virtually makes this a pointless journey. :/
You're the best!\n\nIs there a reason there aren't simple scripts to get past Securom's obfusicating? If it's always the same pattern like you described, why can't you just have something go through the data and get rid of extra functions and the like?

Imagine...\n\n\n\n\n\nFree roam Star Wars Battlefront so you could fly your ship to any planet...\nJesus Christ that would be sick
I’m not buying that crap, not after the first one ☝️
Please tell me there's pods multiplayer
EA: Alright time to stop fuckin around.
Omg I can't wait for the game to come out
Or... They could've just been like siege, adding these new maps, vehicles and heroes in a FREE update to revive Battlefront 1
I want count dooku in here as well
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL CONQUEST GM THEY SAID THEY WERE GONNA ADD?!?!?
This is microtransactions incarnate. Fuck you, EA. Oh, and fuck you too, Disney. Can I use mind trick in this game even if I don't wtf mind trick is? Because Mary Sue Rey could.
It's a shame they had to release the entire first game + 4 or more DLC before they realised the game was a shambles. It shows they knew exactly what to do, just chose not to until now.
This a great improvement over BF1 but the microtransactions/star cards have no place in a full priced game and still no Galactic Conquest. I'll wait for the reviews.
I am not buying this game till I can play as Episode 3 Anakin. You decide how soon that'll be, EA.
Still don't see any Droidekas! The one thing I was looking forward to playing as.....Dam it.
I PRESUME ORDER IT HYPE HYPE HYYYYYYYYPE WAIT IT'S not here HOLD ON ONLY 3 DAYS EARLY ACCESS UGHHH LAME
soo... you mean to say you actually tried this time
I love how it's literally a marketing point to show how shitty the first one is over this one.
OH MYYYYY HOW MANY DLC IS IN THAT GAME
now this is what they should've done with the first one to begin with, well done EA, now to see the catch
This is ... another shitty EA game
Is there no walker assault?? That would suck
Wait..so you're tellin me... They finally listened to us??
Looks like Star fighter mode is separate from being on the ground
Man! That was so well explained and showcased. I am pretty much sold on this :) It looks fucking amazing !
This is getting out of hand. Where ARE those droidekas??
This is honestly a pretty good marketing trailer. I'm not even that hyped for the game and it kind of made me excited.
This is where the fun begins.
Fuck it I'm robbing wal Mart for this shit the hype just made my balls explode
Man y’all should really add “bring cargo” again. That was my favorite game mode on the last battle front game
Star Wars Battlefront EA II. Don't forget you put EA in the title :P
Rey is gonna be the Luke Skywalker from Battlefront I. Except she looks more like a faggot
I see a pay to play. 👀
where is geonsis bf2 is missing best map
It's looks amazing but how dare they say that this is a Star Wars experience like none other. I think you're forgetting about another Star Wars battlefront 2.
I've got a baaad feeling about this. Heroes not locked to their eras will be so off putting, Star cards will ruin balance and the re-skinned Battlefield game modes will tire out quickly. Repeating the same mistakes as Battlefront minus the random weapon pickups. I guess we will never see the old leaked gameplay of Battlefront III come to life. 6/10 for being pretty and unique sp story but uninspired gameplay, imo of course
Hopefully split screen 2plyr online modes as well
4:04 - The new Resistance A-wing! :O\n\nI sure hope they don't let us down with this new Arcade mode. I'm concerned they've focused too much on providing a cinematic single player campaign and not enough on an improved instant action mode like Skirmish was in the last game. That had so much potential and it went to waste. I'm going to be really bummed if Arcade turns out to be an improved version of Missions. An improved instant action mode that supports all maps, modes and a greatly enhanced AI should take priority over a single player campaign.
I'm not gonna bother pre ordering after the first one. enjoyed it but too many annoying features. Wana see how the reviews play out before spending any cash
WHERE IS JAR JAR?!? I need him!
Create Star Wars for VR and then I’ll be impressed
lol just remake the old game with better graphics and customizable weapons. it would sell like crazy
Please change the name so the original battlefront games dont have to be related to this pile of shit.
Why not all games are built like this? It has Beautiful graphics, Can easily run 60fps even in 4k and large multiplayer support, and even Doom and Wolfenstein can pull of such Graphics
How do I get accesses to the beta on the fourth as I pre orderd the game o n disc
This is a good year for gaming, fans are getting what they want for every game. CoD WW2 is boots on the ground and Star Wars BF2 is looking amazing and better than the last one, i’ve missed some games but these two will probably will be the best sellers
I bet this shit won't have Anakin or the Jedi Temple :/
Hm... okay... interesting... wait a tic... WHERE TF IS WALKER ASSAULT??!!?!?!
It seems like they’re heading in the right direction like the old battlefront games.
It would be cool if they had a game mode that was always going, like in planetside, and you fight for territory and at the end of like a week the faction with the most territory get rewarded
What you can play in splitscreen only arcade or more?
But... in these space modes will I be able to board fighters of my choice and fight in starships as well as dogfight in space like in the original SWBF2 (Rest in Peace)?
Well this fixes almost all my complaints about the first one.
John Boyega 2017: Finn will be there of course
The Season Pass for Star Wars Battlefront 1 is free right now for PS4
People are so stupid. 90% of the people out there bitchin and moaning about EVERYTHING. It actually looks like they put the time into this one because the first one was way too simplistic. Everyone seriously needs to take a breath and relax. As soon as people get something they want, they will just bitch about something else.
To address a lot of peoples concerns:\nThis game does have micro transactions in the sense you spend money to get crates with a chance of giving you better start cards. Better star cards means lower cool down and other minor differences. You can still earn these cards by playing the game. It's no different than Battlefield's battle packs or Overwatch's loot crates. Also all the DLC's are free and you will not be required to buy anything more than just the base game. People need to quit complaining and appreciate the fact that the devs have done so much more this time around. They delivered on most things people asked for and yet people continue to find something else to cry about. How about appreciating the fact we get free DLC's and much more.
The first part looked like an uncharted scene
Basically the game we should have gotten in 2015..
Doesnt have galactic conquest. Not worth it.
If there's no garlic bread I'm not interested.
Looks incredible, to bad they did the same boring loot box shit honestly just let people level up for stuff.
Jesus looks so real and amazing omg I can't wait!!!!
Game looks awesome but I'm a little disappoint at only 5 game modes but we'll see how fun the new ones are!
20v20?\nThat's it?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
They had better deliver.
Nice game
I keep watching this Lol
MINDBLOWNINEEDTHIS
Yay. Pay to win mechanics.
Huh all this yet no galatic conquest?
REMEMBER NO PREORDERS!!!
Camino! Thank God.
Boyega is a cuck
Need new undies.... worth it
we need general grevious!!!!!
For the republic!
Looks epic !
Almost as good as battefront 1
Only 20 v 20?\n\nHmm, not sure. :(
pleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuck
HOLY FUCK! This gave me goosebumps...
Is that John Boyega?
Insecure of Paragon much?
20 versus 20 wtf ???
Lite
MORE OFFLINE MODES PLEASE
Waiting for the downgrade
0:48 made me cringe so hard.....
Dat blue milk money
Watch those wrist rockets
4:07 Watch those wrist rockets!
Woah woah woah only five game modes?!
At 2:28 I seen Chewy!!!
2:58 lol rip Kylo
No Droidekas as playable characters??? :( Or are they going to be star-card weapons (if they Actually appear in the game)?
Will I be in the game?
02:26 Chewy stands on a nail 🤔
Still praying for galactic conquest :(
Star Wars: Battlefront III\n2015\nStop lying EA
Fuel been l's chi PC ebb crash cash l's penis hurt when touch inside did cut Mhz Nippon khan oz Rica site basis also pal pillion Philadelphia Mcdonald's stoical medics dud
I am really looking forward to be playing as darth maul and Kylo ren
This looks absolutely amazing. But honestly, I think the game would benefit if it didn't include cross Era heroes in galactic assault and starfighter assault. It really takes away from the immersion when you see Rey killing battle droids. Star Wars fans crave authenticity.
It looks pretty awesome! Just like my UCS Millennium Falcon Time Lapse Build!!!! https://youtu.be/3AO6zDEzHzo
This video is basically \n\nDICE: GUYS WE'RE SORRY !
This is star wars battlefront 2: *the same as swbf1 but now with the season pass included, which is how swbf1 should've been.*\n\nI mean cmn this games nothing special
I want this game NOW
Only 5 game modes :( last one had like ten and that was the best part about that game.
star fighter assault for the republic
I don't know if I should be excited to see you,or not @jon boyega (don't know if this is how you spell it). I just haven't seen enough of you.....
This gonna be 1st game i used money to bought it
Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen heroes. Secret power: Burn up, where your hero catches on fire and burns to a crisp. EXTRA POINTS FOR IF YOU ACTIVATE THIS POWER INFRONT OF ANAKIN OR LUKE SKYWALKER!!!!!! It introduces new buff: Traumatize!
This is GOTY (hopefully).\nZelda fanboys pls, if BOTW comes out with free dlc(s). OK I get it. I really didn't see the appeal for BOTW the game looked quite boring.
GoW4, Battlefront, and *Red fucking Dead 2*! My PS4 is finally going to have a purpose. I bought this shit this year and so far it's a fucking decor.
0:16 Finn, Star Wars THE LAST JEDI\ndid they lose their minds?
So...we will not have 32 vs 32 on Battlefront II ? like Battlefield?
Most of these 14 characters and some maps will be reused ones from previous games. smh. Anyone who preorders this, have fun with your rehashed game.
still 20 v 20 ugh. what ever looks way better than the first bf
EA, Star Wars, Disney... the ultimate combo in controlling consumer sheep.
I am like Fin
I just wish they didn't include any Disney stuff in a Star Wars game
I'm so amped up
why the fuck is everyone praising this shit, no galactic conquest no boarding ships its the same fucking shit except with a damn story mode im mad af
20 vs 20 ...that is pathetic..by now I would expect at least 150 vs 150....
**Who else thinks star wars battlefront 2 should include customized battle sequences from epic scenes from the movies and make game modes around that.. even if maybe some heroes or characters wouldn't fit the plot story or lore I think it would be an amazing thing.. \n\nImagine having to stop the invasion of the clones or saving Naboo from the droids or the attack on that place in episode one with Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi... I bet millions of die hard fans would love to reenact the famous Darth Maul scene with Liam Neeson and Swan McGregor.\n\nHell I bet many would love to play the epic scene involving the destruction of the first death star. \n\nMake it happen EA.\n\n MAKE STAR WARS GAMES GREAT AGAIN!**
looks awesome the Yavin IV map seems like the Yavin temples of jedi knight saga I love it
Can you play it on EA Access?
Looks great, but all i want is the normal conquest mode like in the old battlefront games.
Cant wait to get my ps4
Like this so EA can see it\nHero List:\nAshoka, Anakin,Obi Wan, General Grevious, Mace Windu, Dooku, Padme, Jango Phett & Captain Rex! Please EA get these characters in the game!:)
Just me who loved that John Byoga talked over everything
Oh C’mon now i want to play this EEEEEEEEVEN more>:(
All I want is space battles and land battles going on at the same time that can be seamlessly transitioned between. I know, I know never gonna happen... but I don't care.
Anyone else see Luke just make Kylo look like an absolute bitch with the force?
Ik it's john boyega but is it sad that at first I thought it was KSI?
I like it more than other!
Is their even any point to play the first Battlefront anymore!? Lol seriously
This looks like a improved version of star wars battlefront 2 the original. So im pretty impressee
RELEASE THE DAMN GAME BEFORE I PISS MESELF
Woah it seems so cool I'm gonna get it once I get the money!
Thanks to star cards, new players are still at a disadvantage against players that have earned lots of star cards. \n\nAlso, because of the battle point system, players that are not particularly good will not be able to play the game the way they want. They won't be able to easily attain vehicles or characters they wish to use, which may ultimately ruin their gameplay experience.\n\nAlso still no capital ship to capital ship combat like in Pandemic's Battlefront 2.\n\nCome on DICE, all you had to do was give the fans what they want, an update to Pandemic's battlefront games with conquest mode and ground to space combat, including capital ships.
can't tell from the trailer if the maps are painfully linear\n\nalso, if there are no bots, it's not worth getting. bots are great filler and act as fodder while doing objectives. it's what kept the real battlefront alive for so long.
I'm hesitant, especially with all this star cards battle points parts nonsense, my microtransaction senses are tingling. \n\nThey're using the name, they've got even bigger shoes to fill.
Finally they basically made it Battlefront but Battlefield style.
Can you say \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP A Y 2 W I N\nThanks EA, fuck you
I’ll still wait to buy. Not going to pre order. Looks dope but I’m no fool.
I'd rather have a reskinned and remastered battlefield with some space incorporated into it. The Vehicle spawning still triggers me at most lol
You should give away for free this game to all of the brave souls like me who bought your first shit! That would be a good apology
Is splitscreen arcade playing the multiplayer modes with bots or is it like a wave survival? And are we able to play the multiplayer modes splitscreen offline?
All soldiers of the Empire....\nThe Rebellion has thrown the Galaxy into chaos. It has taken from us Order! Stability! The very peace they claim to fight for has been shattered by their treason. And worst of all....they have taken our Emperor! But Fear not, brave sons and daughters of our great Empire, for the war has just begun. The Rebel dogs think us beaten, and even now celebrate their victory. We shall show them that such celebrations are foolishly naive. Remember why we fight.  Fight for those who are in your thoughts! Fight so that your families may know Order and Stability rather than Chaos and Anarchy! Fight to avenge our fallen, those brave souls now at rest. Fight for every trooper beside you, your brothers in arms! Do not count the days, do not count the Parsecs, count only the number of Rebels you have killed! This is the cry of your Empire! Death to the Rebellion!
would be cool if you could chose whether you want to force push or force pull doesn't need to be in the game just something cool that i would like added
will all the  heroes and maps from the first game be returning in battlefront 2?
Ok, but if you don't have era specific heros, it's gonna be kinda weird and stupid
If those crates mean micro transactions then I'm going to flip the fuck out
I want to see Gangnam Style and gentleman as an emote
* just bought star wars battlefront and then sees this *\n\nU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!!?
I wish I could play this game - I only have Nintendo consoles, and I'm not interested in buying a PS4 for the one game I would want on it.  I would buy this game on Switch in a heartbeat.  And don't tell me it won't run - if games like Doom 2016 and Wolfenstein 2 are coming to Switch, please don't tell me it can't happen.  I am thankful you're bringing FIFA, but I'm not going to buy it - I'm not into sports games.  Never have been.  Give me Star Wars.
These (allmost) 5 minutes felt like an hour of fun!!!
This is one of the Best vid i've Steen in my life
Now this... this looks good.
Lol he says 20v20 like it's a big deal
The time has come.\n\nExecute Pre-order 66.
Охренеть! !  Разделенный экран^ куплю обязательно!.

4:16 Yoda would absolutely dick on Maul.
Fucking CRATES!!!
Me gusta star wars batterfront 2
A i tak wyjdzie z tego kupa.
Will this game run on my pc ?\nPentium G4400 \nMOBO MSI PRO-D\nGTX 1050 \n8 gb ram\nI just want to play this without crashes. I don't care about graphics
Font colour yellow, brackets need to be rewritten to format
Very good and nice
It looked pretty interesting until you can find them in crates ...mmkay seeya next time EA
I love John Boyega’s voice
Why is not Rex or Fives in the game😭
What u should know about Darth Vader, funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlYNwEWAUoU
What happened to all the game modes on the first one? They should have carried them over as well
the sound design of the shooting, explosions and hits are amazing
who tf is gonna choose rei over maul
Basically a remastered version of the original star Wars battle field 1 which instead of coming out with the newer bf1 they shoulda just came out with this
i almost died when i saw that content!!
I didn't think that i would say this, but this actually looks amazing!
So cross hero gameplay is a thing :/
I want to know if Matt the Radar Technician be added to the game at some point.
I was so happy to hear the game mode galactic assault and then they said 20vs20.\nWhere is the old version where you could split screen, choose between the empire or republic and duke it out across the universe taking planets and destroying your friends fleet in space...\nplayers of the originals will understand what I mean, although there is more content here I really hope that EA could throw this game mode back in.
Game could be good but it isn't! Same shitty system like the first one and like bf one as well! Why could EA not saty with the old battlefront? Or like bf3?
This is Star Wars Battlefront Two, where we give you features the originals had ten years ago and pretend we're being innovative
Boy the compression took a hit LMFAO
People talking about “free dlc”.... you forgot they’re adding micro transactions to make up for that money?
Ps4 footage my ass. The particles and textures are beyond ps4 can handle. I doubt this will even match final version.
Bet your tits I'm playin heros vs villains all day everyday
EA......... this looks pretty badass so far.......... SO PLEASE DON'T FUCK THIS UP AND MAKE IT A GREEDY DLC FEST LIKE THE LAST GAME.
The pay to win is strong in you young Battlefront 2...
So fucking hot I'm excited
Kylo ren...  i honestly think they screwed up the whole entire series adding him
I'm trying not to get my hopes up lol
I know I wasn’t the only one that had GOOSE bumps
I don't think enough people are talking about how Heros and Ships and stuff are not randomly places on the map now. The better you play the more youll be a hero, which is how it SHOULD be.
EA should've added Tr-8r as a hero character
Every time obi wan spawns he better be saying Hello there or this game fails
Why not galactic conquest smh that was am amazing part of the old ones, bring it back!
I was so happy watching this, then they mentioned loot boxes. Then I remembered this is EA.
Can you play the single player campaign with a friend?
This video just convinced me to pre order this game. Where are my pants? Lol 😂
There are levels of rarity in star cards - Ayy my favorite
EA, I can almost hear Bakers voice as the clones. EA, why not Morris? EA?! IS IT BAKER OR MORRIS?!!
This game shouldn't be getting hate, because they fixed everything and listened to their fans. This game looks EPIC!!! Definitely buying... when the price goes down a bit ( probably after a month or two XD ) But i definitely recommend you buy this game!!!
No matter how good this game is, some people will hate it just because it’s EA.
This made my nuts wet.
When EA wanna bump up the hype train but you don't wanna get dissapointed yet:\n\nI'm one with the force and the force is with me, I'm one with the force and the force is with me, I'm one with the force and the force is with me.....
They better of gotten rid of that bitch ass shield that completely destroyed the fun out of the first one. you'd be seconds away from killing someone and that motherfucker would activate that shield and run off into the sunset as you get killed trying to claim that kill.
Will it be on Steam?
I want to take Yoda, my favourite character
Good but until lightsaber combat gets better than what they showed us I ain't buying
new star wars mmo with these graphics <3 <3
I swear if they don't nerf the Scattergun
Political Correctness shit plus the space fights looks like the planes are all just gliding too damn slow.
There is no R2B2 engaged in assisting the battle, this isn't worth playing.
Cant wait to play this\nI hope EA makes this the battlefront game we all can enjoy and get so much satisfaction from.\n\n really have high hopes for this
instead of finn we could have anakin for the force sake
Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005) still looks and will be vastly better. Fucking lol. 14 maps.\n\n\n\n*1 4*\n\n\n\n*L o l*\n\nInstant action?\n*No.*\nGalactic conquest?\n*No.*\nMods?\n*No.*\nSingle player campaign that's actually likeable and not cookie cutter?\n*No.*\nGood game? \n*You bet your ass not.*
Let me guess... DLC...More DLC...Mirco-Transactions... Even More Mirco-Tranactions...spending $150 for an incomplete game that requires me to purchase DLC.... I doubt this BattleFront 2 will beat the Original...
Damn, this game looks crisp. It brings new life into Star Wars
There are so many Sith and Jedi from the expanded universe you could add in the game and you edgy phase Kylo ren
Can people who bought Battle Front 1 please get a discount or some reward for buying this one?
but CAN you get IN and OUT of the vehicles? and transport friends in 2 person ships?
Love This game I played The first one Amazing.. BUT IT'S MISSING a few things that would take this game to the next level.  LIKE CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION AND It Would be nice to be able to keep your level from SWB Pt. 1 AND EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO LEVEL UP AND BECOME A BOUNTY HUNTER, JEDI OR SITH WITH YOUR CHARACTER JUST SAYIN.
We've captured the command post! That's all I want to hear
Right, but how does this compare to Star Wars Battlefront 2?\n\nThat's the question everyone really wants answered.
EA u call this a game?!?\n\n\n\n\n\nI call it a masterpiece
Looks absolutely amazing!!\nIm speechless!!!!! \n(Like if u agree)!
2:29 You just cant have nice things
Finally a game where they focus on the villains and not the good guys even tho I think the dark side is way better than the light side who agrees
Nothing pisses me off in these kinds of comments sections then 10 year old's bragging about how they and all their friends pre-ordered the most expensive edition.  They are constantly disappointed by horrible games, but they never stop.
Quick question, do Banthas count as vehicles?
Wow
And singleplayer hah?
WE NEED MORE
p2w?
This is unrealistic but I want the following heroes after DLC...\nAnakin\nObi-wan\nPadme\nMace Windu\nYoda\nAhsoka\nCaptain Rex\nDarth Maul\nCount Dooku\nGeneral Grievous\nJango Fett\nAsajj Ventress\nSavage Opress\nCad Bane\nLuke\nLeia\nHan Solo\nChewbacca\nLando\nNien Nunb\nJyn Erso\nDarth Vader\nPalpatine\nBoba Fett\nGreedo\nBossk\nDengar\nKrennic\nRey\nFinn\nPoe\nKylo Ren\nPhasma\nHux

FIX THE BOTS
Cuando aprenden de los errores del pasado
Like si querías que hubiesen mas de 100 unidades en la batalla como antiguamente
Another female protagonist.. For fucks sake.
In this new island they should not reward rushing. It gives the other person a huge advantage in attack. Instead they should make it so there are leagues for each builder hall lvl. I cannot tell you the amount of times I did well on a bh6 just to find out I get 3 starred by max leveled witches. In conclusion, they should reward players for taking there time with there base and have them face off against each other.

hi supercell! we are glad to see that supercell. has been giving many updates. I am also feeling well that supercell had released builder hall level 7 ,but I want to convey to you that, it's to boring to attack only using by our troops at builder hall. I want to say to you just, we want spells at builder hall so,  please supercell accept our request, and. think something about my sayings.
At 0:13 is that builder hall 8
Nice its all we are waiting for
This video is awesome and misleading. It's for builderhall level 8. At start of video you see 2 Guard Posts. At some point mid video we see level 8 Crusher and level 8 Firecrackers too.
Add a second builder!! It takes to long with just one
I hope they fix the matchmaking. I don’t want to be paired against bh7 as a bh6. Ima get recked every time. And I hate rushing
what about main village we stuck in 11 for ages
I like it ... sub
Where is the main village update supercell.. Getting bored with the main village.. CLASH ON ✌️✌️
Important update we cant have fun in bh base if we dont have friendly battles add it please,  also balance the match up we hate matching with max troops its annoying
You can find builder hall 8 and its upgrades in the vid
Plz help me my 511 gems has disappeared how no one used it
I'm only one builder hall 2. These money grabbing whores made it so u can only have one builder wtf.

Haven’t played in forever too many micro transactions to actually progress in the game

0:10 GG Supercell you ban for leaking updates and stuff, and you're leaking  all the BH8 :v
If it comes so how can it look
Wow !!!! I just want to say this much
Dear supercell this player #88CROJYJY using bad words in our family clan. Plz block this person. His acount name is $h!$h!r. He always write bad words in clan joining rqst box and when we accept to warn him he leave certainly. We can not do anything. Our family members have to ready all bad words. Which is abusive.
Oh look it's on trending
Dont fall for this trap.. The game is designed to get you to spend money.. U will never max your Builder hall base without gems. And you will always face opponents with better defenses.. This is psychological warfare. I have a max townhall 11 and they wont even give me more walls to update.. supercell only cares about one thing and that is maximizing profits.. They employ psychologists to help design the game to be addictive. They target the Reward Zone of your brain. This is why u get upset when u lose and your first thought is.. Wish I had some gems. Everyone should boycott the builder base.  Those guys at the top with gemmed bases are givwn gems by supercell. Notice how they cater to the youtubers because they have 10,000 gem spending spree videos.. They are paid in gems to get you to buy gems.. This game was fun. Now its just a money pit.. Shame on you supercell
Love clash royal da best 😀😀 all so mincraft and Roblox yaa Yt to😀😀😀😏😏😄🤗🤗😄😄😏😍😜😍😘😘😘😬😬😬😬😆😆😁😬😀😄😄😄😀

Omg i thought that pewdiepie was most subbed but Clearly not!! 77mill!!!!
AdSense communities: should we give most of our ads to pewdiepie or music.     \nHead of the community: nah give it to clash of clans their videos always go trending
It's a prequel guys they had Dutch in the trailer
Van der Linde was a side character that wasn't as important as Bill Williamson or Javier Escuela.\n\nAlllllrighhhht, then...
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info
When is bully 2 coming i am excited about that ☺
magnificent 7 was a great movie
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?
For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3.
Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
I seen this trailer
Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.
yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
I swear this game better then the GTA series
Is it for PC though.?
This is what happens when you put two idiots in charge..
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
It's just a cut scene of cowboys eating at camp, this is how games get hyped beyond all reason, rockstar games or not.
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
It's comes out in auttum
there was a morality system in red dead redemption
Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer
Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
lol Marty was all over the place in this video
I can finally hang myself in peace.
I really hope it’s not all online
That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
How did they not recognize Dutch
I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game.
Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
yo I cant wait for it
No game no hype, those are the rules.
Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April.
hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters...
He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you...
“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol
Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
I only care about multiplayer!
can preorder now. o yeah were close
throwing my money at the screen, want to pre-order, but can't find it on STEAM????????????
are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
it could be as late as june.
I'm betting and hope one of the  main characters is a the native american with the rag sack.
THE HYPE TRAIN is gone!!!! this is a must!!!
Marty's hands keep shaking, is that hype?
I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking.
How will they work shark cards into this...
Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much
Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
DID YOU HAVE TO PUT A TIMER IN THE BEGINNING
The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day
Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
Best open world game ever Coming right up
RDR2 will look and play best on Xbox One X!\nStay tuned, pc to run this @ 0p & 0fps.
Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of..
any players who havent played rdr but likes cowboys?
Coming 2019
I'm playing this on Xbox one X can't wait
I want gta 6
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2
In-depth horse relationship   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Yeah!!!
downgrade ?

Amateurs....
great hype much erection
DUTCH VAN DER LINDE jeez

Wow 1 hour stream for 1 min trailer ggwp idiots
This is how uncreative IGN is
Fully torqued
PC?
omg can`t wait
The baddest mofo in red dead is still Juan Sierra: Quien quiere peleyar con migo!

Hyped
What's interesting from both trailer's is the wild life. They seem to have their own eco system where they'll hunt, feed, dehydrate etc. In Red Dead 1 the animals will just stand there and any predators will hunt you and nothing else. But in Red Dead 2 trailer The predators look as though they'll will hunt & kill other prey as well as your self. What's more interesting is the way this new eco system will impact on your horses. Do they get hungry, thirsty or even die of natural causes? Cos' maintaining your horse is a whole new gameplay mechanic not encountered before and will be very interesting to see in game.
Was that captured on a high-end PC? I'd love if it did, but I doubt it'll look like that on my PS4.
You guys are literally oblivious lol that was a younger Dutch in the trailer so this is going to be a prequel and you can bet that john is going to make an appearance
I can't wait for the multiplayer coop that we just couldn't get right in GTA\n*SOMEBODY WANTS TO JOIN YOUR POSSE*
That man with the magnificent mustache is Dutch motherfuckin Van Der Linde.
Will this have shark cards??! I WANNA BUY A COTTON FARM
I AM\nHYPED FOR THIS 👀🤓
How stupid are these guys! That politician is Dutch, the leader of the gang!!! ARGHHH And its definitely a prequel!
If you're the supposed experts that are going to analyze the trailer how about at least reading the synopsis of the first one on the wiki? 😑
We don't know if it's a prequel Young Dutch was in the trailer you dopes...
How did these guys not hear him say Always Dutch.
It's a prequel guys they had Dutch in the trailer
Van der Linde was a side character that wasn't as important as Bill Williamson or Javier Escuela.\n\nAlllllrighhhht, then...
My god, this rampant speculation is why people always get over-hyped and are ultimately disappointed in games. Temper your expectations, people. I get it, you're excited, but let's be a little realistic here.
Seriously? We knew it was a prequel when they showed us the first trailer.
Wow. You really know nothing. Of course it is a prequel and from the trailer it is crystal clear that it is. Do you prepare for such a show at all?
Just look to the right the trailer has already been released
Watching this while in a lecture session lol
Will the be available on the Sega Genesis?
Wow only fuckin 6 months because of delay...... smh rockstar
hey ign your description says its a sequel LMAO ITS PREQUEL
what an abysmal analysis. took them like ten minutes to realize who dutch is and that its a prequel. and they only found out because chat told them... pretty pathetic
I feel like the kid in the trailer is john and this character, Morgan, will at several points cross paths with John. I think this new character is gonna betray Dutch at some point and maybe Marston will be the guy that kills him.
Only real ones watch the entire 24 min loading screen
Rockstar isn't EA or Ubisoft.\n\nHype
Off topic but does anybody know any good STD clinics around?
Tom Sellick character   ? thats Dutch and he was the main villain ...did you guys even play the game?
They are so good at covering games that they do'nt remember Dutch, and that he is old in RDR, and here we see Dutch way younger, so props to IGN for being so good at seeing everything but the obvious...
“Morgan” calls the man at the end “Dutch” I’m presuming Dutch Vanderlin.....
YOU GOT SOME MONEY FOR ME BOY
stil not on pc
hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
Dutch Van der Linde was anything but a minor character. He was the leader of Dutch's gang and John Marston's boss before the original Red Dead Redemption.
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
Can we have Indians in this one
You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought
Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video

I was hoping for\nSpring 2018 but to tide you over Red Dead Redemtion remaster this holiday for Ps4, Xbox One, Switch and PC!
If I cant climb up or paraglide off that cliff, i wont buy!
AT LAST\nIVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
But they already released the new trailer....?
I want a GTA5 style online game where you can ride with your posse and do co op bank heist's and train robberies. Cant wait for this game, wish it was out before Christmas.
Is it just me or does the badass stab lady look like bonnie mcfarlane from rdr?

I think the woman is Annie Stokes from Red Dead Revolver!
Watching theses two grasp at straws try to gleam anything from a one minute trailer is ridiculous
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2
It has to be a prequel because dutch is in the end !!!!!!
WTF? there wasn't sound!

are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
it could be as late as june.
I'm betting and hope one of the  main characters is a the native american with the rag sack.
hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
Is it for PC though.?
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info
When is bully 2 coming i am excited about that ☺
magnificent 7 was a great movie
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?
For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3.
Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
I seen this trailer
Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
Can we have Indians in this one
You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking.
How will they work shark cards into this...
Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much
single player dlcs will always be better than online ones! always!
Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day
Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
Best open world game ever Coming right up
RDR2 will look and play best on Xbox One X!\nStay tuned, pc to run this @ 0p & 0fps.
Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of..
I'm playing this on Xbox one X can't wait
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2
yo I cant wait for it
Marty's hands keep shaking, is that hype?

I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.
yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
I swear this game better then the GTA series
This is what happens when you put two idiots in charge..
It's just a cut scene of cowboys eating at camp, this is how games get hyped beyond all reason, rockstar games or not.
It's comes out in auttum
there was a morality system in red dead redemption
Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer
Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
lol Marty was all over the place in this video
I can finally hang myself in peace.
I really hope it’s not all online
That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
How did they not recognize Dutch
I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game.
Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about.
No game no hype, those are the rules.
Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April.
hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters...
He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you...
“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol
Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
I only care about multiplayer!
can preorder now. o yeah were close

single player dlcs will always be better than online ones! always!
Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)

A game idea I have... FRIENDLY CHALLENGES IN CLANS ON BUILDERS BASE... Yes, a friendly challenge between clanmates. The same as in the home town, but only available in builders hall.\nIt will be a good way for players to test their builder bases with friends before taking on the world...\n\nLike if you agree...

Dear Clash of clans\n\n     There's a bug inside of the game.In the news says the battle machine can be upgraded to level 15 but I saw in the top players their battle machine was level 20.
I like this game
Godson still has the best style though!
Supercell there should be an option to buy another super builder
How do they matchup against each other on builder base?
Now I am hall 7

I just 3 starred a base with dragons. The dragons were only 4K elixir because of the event, same for the lighting spell. The base that I 3 starred had 1,100,000 elixir!\nThat’s what I call a “Positive elixir Trade”  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Clash of clans is my favourite game.Supercell can you give to me the Mega knight in clash royale
So is a Klaus a real life idiot? I think so. Makes it hard to listen when he talks. He makes himself sound like a retard child next to Galadon.

Imagine...\n\n\n\n\n\nFree roam Star Wars Battlefront so you could fly your ship to any planet...\nJesus Christ that would be sick
I’m not buying that crap, not after the first one ☝️
Please tell me there's pods multiplayer
EA: Alright time to stop fuckin around.
Omg I can't wait for the game to come out
Or... They could've just been like siege, adding these new maps, vehicles and heroes in a FREE update to revive Battlefront 1
I want count dooku in here as well
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL CONQUEST GM THEY SAID THEY WERE GONNA ADD?!?!?
This is microtransactions incarnate. Fuck you, EA. Oh, and fuck you too, Disney. Can I use mind trick in this game even if I don't wtf mind trick is? Because Mary Sue Rey could.
It's a shame they had to release the entire first game + 4 or more DLC before they realised the game was a shambles. It shows they knew exactly what to do, just chose not to until now.
This a great improvement over BF1 but the microtransactions/star cards have no place in a full priced game and still no Galactic Conquest. I'll wait for the reviews.
I am not buying this game till I can play as Episode 3 Anakin. You decide how soon that'll be, EA.
Still don't see any Droidekas! The one thing I was looking forward to playing as.....Dam it.
I PRESUME ORDER IT HYPE HYPE HYYYYYYYYPE WAIT IT'S not here HOLD ON ONLY 3 DAYS EARLY ACCESS UGHHH LAME
soo... you mean to say you actually tried this time
I love how it's literally a marketing point to show how shitty the first one is over this one.
OH MYYYYY HOW MANY DLC IS IN THAT GAME
now this is what they should've done with the first one to begin with, well done EA, now to see the catch
This is ... another shitty EA game
Is there no walker assault?? That would suck
Wait..so you're tellin me... They finally listened to us??
Looks like Star fighter mode is separate from being on the ground
Man! That was so well explained and showcased. I am pretty much sold on this :) It looks fucking amazing !
This is getting out of hand. Where ARE those droidekas??
This is honestly a pretty good marketing trailer. I'm not even that hyped for the game and it kind of made me excited.
This is where the fun begins.
Fuck it I'm robbing wal Mart for this shit the hype just made my balls explode
Man y’all should really add “bring cargo” again. That was my favorite game mode on the last battle front game
Star Wars Battlefront EA II. Don't forget you put EA in the title :P
Rey is gonna be the Luke Skywalker from Battlefront I. Except she looks more like a faggot
I see a pay to play. 👀
where is geonsis bf2 is missing best map
It's looks amazing but how dare they say that this is a Star Wars experience like none other. I think you're forgetting about another Star Wars battlefront 2.
I've got a baaad feeling about this. Heroes not locked to their eras will be so off putting, Star cards will ruin balance and the re-skinned Battlefield game modes will tire out quickly. Repeating the same mistakes as Battlefront minus the random weapon pickups. I guess we will never see the old leaked gameplay of Battlefront III come to life. 6/10 for being pretty and unique sp story but uninspired gameplay, imo of course
Hopefully split screen 2plyr online modes as well
4:04 - The new Resistance A-wing! :O\n\nI sure hope they don't let us down with this new Arcade mode. I'm concerned they've focused too much on providing a cinematic single player campaign and not enough on an improved instant action mode like Skirmish was in the last game. That had so much potential and it went to waste. I'm going to be really bummed if Arcade turns out to be an improved version of Missions. An improved instant action mode that supports all maps, modes and a greatly enhanced AI should take priority over a single player campaign.
I'm not gonna bother pre ordering after the first one. enjoyed it but too many annoying features. Wana see how the reviews play out before spending any cash
WHERE IS JAR JAR?!? I need him!
Create Star Wars for VR and then I’ll be impressed
lol just remake the old game with better graphics and customizable weapons. it would sell like crazy
Please change the name so the original battlefront games dont have to be related to this pile of shit.
Why not all games are built like this? It has Beautiful graphics, Can easily run 60fps even in 4k and large multiplayer support, and even Doom and Wolfenstein can pull of such Graphics
How do I get accesses to the beta on the fourth as I pre orderd the game o n disc
This is a good year for gaming, fans are getting what they want for every game. CoD WW2 is boots on the ground and Star Wars BF2 is looking amazing and better than the last one, i’ve missed some games but these two will probably will be the best sellers
I bet this shit won't have Anakin or the Jedi Temple :/
Hm... okay... interesting... wait a tic... WHERE TF IS WALKER ASSAULT??!!?!?!
It seems like they’re heading in the right direction like the old battlefront games.
It would be cool if they had a game mode that was always going, like in planetside, and you fight for territory and at the end of like a week the faction with the most territory get rewarded
What you can play in splitscreen only arcade or more?
But... in these space modes will I be able to board fighters of my choice and fight in starships as well as dogfight in space like in the original SWBF2 (Rest in Peace)?
Well this fixes almost all my complaints about the first one.
John Boyega 2017: Finn will be there of course
The Season Pass for Star Wars Battlefront 1 is free right now for PS4
People are so stupid. 90% of the people out there bitchin and moaning about EVERYTHING. It actually looks like they put the time into this one because the first one was way too simplistic. Everyone seriously needs to take a breath and relax. As soon as people get something they want, they will just bitch about something else.
To address a lot of peoples concerns:\nThis game does have micro transactions in the sense you spend money to get crates with a chance of giving you better start cards. Better star cards means lower cool down and other minor differences. You can still earn these cards by playing the game. It's no different than Battlefield's battle packs or Overwatch's loot crates. Also all the DLC's are free and you will not be required to buy anything more than just the base game. People need to quit complaining and appreciate the fact that the devs have done so much more this time around. They delivered on most things people asked for and yet people continue to find something else to cry about. How about appreciating the fact we get free DLC's and much more.
The first part looked like an uncharted scene
Basically the game we should have gotten in 2015..
Doesnt have galactic conquest. Not worth it.
If there's no garlic bread I'm not interested.
Looks incredible, to bad they did the same boring loot box shit honestly just let people level up for stuff.
Jesus looks so real and amazing omg I can't wait!!!!
Game looks awesome but I'm a little disappoint at only 5 game modes but we'll see how fun the new ones are!
20v20?\nThat's it?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
They had better deliver.
Nice game
I keep watching this Lol
MINDBLOWNINEEDTHIS
Yay. Pay to win mechanics.
Huh all this yet no galatic conquest?
REMEMBER NO PREORDERS!!!
Camino! Thank God.
Boyega is a cuck
Need new undies.... worth it
we need general grevious!!!!!
For the republic!
Looks epic !
Almost as good as battefront 1
Only 20 v 20?\n\nHmm, not sure. :(

At 2:28 I seen Chewy!!!
2:58 lol rip Kylo
No Droidekas as playable characters??? :( Or are they going to be star-card weapons (if they Actually appear in the game)?
Will I be in the game?
02:26 Chewy stands on a nail 🤔
Still praying for galactic conquest :(
Star Wars: Battlefront III\n2015\nStop lying EA
Fuel been l's chi PC ebb crash cash l's penis hurt when touch inside did cut Mhz Nippon khan oz Rica site basis also pal pillion Philadelphia Mcdonald's stoical medics dud
I am really looking forward to be playing as darth maul and Kylo ren
This looks absolutely amazing. But honestly, I think the game would benefit if it didn't include cross Era heroes in galactic assault and starfighter assault. It really takes away from the immersion when you see Rey killing battle droids. Star Wars fans crave authenticity.
It looks pretty awesome! Just like my UCS Millennium Falcon Time Lapse Build!!!! https://youtu.be/3AO6zDEzHzo
This video is basically \n\nDICE: GUYS WE'RE SORRY !
This is star wars battlefront 2: *the same as swbf1 but now with the season pass included, which is how swbf1 should've been.*\n\nI mean cmn this games nothing special
I want this game NOW
Only 5 game modes :( last one had like ten and that was the best part about that game.
star fighter assault for the republic
I don't know if I should be excited to see you,or not @jon boyega (don't know if this is how you spell it). I just haven't seen enough of you.....
This gonna be 1st game i used money to bought it
Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen heroes. Secret power: Burn up, where your hero catches on fire and burns to a crisp. EXTRA POINTS FOR IF YOU ACTIVATE THIS POWER INFRONT OF ANAKIN OR LUKE SKYWALKER!!!!!! It introduces new buff: Traumatize!
This is GOTY (hopefully).\nZelda fanboys pls, if BOTW comes out with free dlc(s). OK I get it. I really didn't see the appeal for BOTW the game looked quite boring.
GoW4, Battlefront, and *Red fucking Dead 2*! My PS4 is finally going to have a purpose. I bought this shit this year and so far it's a fucking decor.
0:16 Finn, Star Wars THE LAST JEDI\ndid they lose their minds?
So...we will not have 32 vs 32 on Battlefront II ? like Battlefield?
Most of these 14 characters and some maps will be reused ones from previous games. smh. Anyone who preorders this, have fun with your rehashed game.
still 20 v 20 ugh. what ever looks way better than the first bf
EA, Star Wars, Disney... the ultimate combo in controlling consumer sheep.
I am like Fin
I just wish they didn't include any Disney stuff in a Star Wars game
I'm so amped up
why the fuck is everyone praising this shit, no galactic conquest no boarding ships its the same fucking shit except with a damn story mode im mad af
20 vs 20 ...that is pathetic..by now I would expect at least 150 vs 150....
**Who else thinks star wars battlefront 2 should include customized battle sequences from epic scenes from the movies and make game modes around that.. even if maybe some heroes or characters wouldn't fit the plot story or lore I think it would be an amazing thing.. \n\nImagine having to stop the invasion of the clones or saving Naboo from the droids or the attack on that place in episode one with Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi... I bet millions of die hard fans would love to reenact the famous Darth Maul scene with Liam Neeson and Swan McGregor.\n\nHell I bet many would love to play the epic scene involving the destruction of the first death star. \n\nMake it happen EA.\n\n MAKE STAR WARS GAMES GREAT AGAIN!**
looks awesome the Yavin IV map seems like the Yavin temples of jedi knight saga I love it
Can you play it on EA Access?
Looks great, but all i want is the normal conquest mode like in the old battlefront games.
Cant wait to get my ps4
Like this so EA can see it\nHero List:\nAshoka, Anakin,Obi Wan, General Grevious, Mace Windu, Dooku, Padme, Jango Phett & Captain Rex! Please EA get these characters in the game!:)
Just me who loved that John Byoga talked over everything
Oh C’mon now i want to play this EEEEEEEEVEN more>:(
All I want is space battles and land battles going on at the same time that can be seamlessly transitioned between. I know, I know never gonna happen... but I don't care.
Anyone else see Luke just make Kylo look like an absolute bitch with the force?
Ik it's john boyega but is it sad that at first I thought it was KSI?
I like it more than other!
Is their even any point to play the first Battlefront anymore!? Lol seriously
This looks like a improved version of star wars battlefront 2 the original. So im pretty impressee
RELEASE THE DAMN GAME BEFORE I PISS MESELF
Woah it seems so cool I'm gonna get it once I get the money!
Thanks to star cards, new players are still at a disadvantage against players that have earned lots of star cards. \n\nAlso, because of the battle point system, players that are not particularly good will not be able to play the game the way they want. They won't be able to easily attain vehicles or characters they wish to use, which may ultimately ruin their gameplay experience.\n\nAlso still no capital ship to capital ship combat like in Pandemic's Battlefront 2.\n\nCome on DICE, all you had to do was give the fans what they want, an update to Pandemic's battlefront games with conquest mode and ground to space combat, including capital ships.
can't tell from the trailer if the maps are painfully linear\n\nalso, if there are no bots, it's not worth getting. bots are great filler and act as fodder while doing objectives. it's what kept the real battlefront alive for so long.
I'm hesitant, especially with all this star cards battle points parts nonsense, my microtransaction senses are tingling. \n\nThey're using the name, they've got even bigger shoes to fill.
Finally they basically made it Battlefront but Battlefield style.
Can you say \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP A Y 2 W I N\nThanks EA, fuck you
I’ll still wait to buy. Not going to pre order. Looks dope but I’m no fool.
I'd rather have a reskinned and remastered battlefield with some space incorporated into it. The Vehicle spawning still triggers me at most lol
You should give away for free this game to all of the brave souls like me who bought your first shit! That would be a good apology
Is splitscreen arcade playing the multiplayer modes with bots or is it like a wave survival? And are we able to play the multiplayer modes splitscreen offline?
All soldiers of the Empire....\nThe Rebellion has thrown the Galaxy into chaos. It has taken from us Order! Stability! The very peace they claim to fight for has been shattered by their treason. And worst of all....they have taken our Emperor! But Fear not, brave sons and daughters of our great Empire, for the war has just begun. The Rebel dogs think us beaten, and even now celebrate their victory. We shall show them that such celebrations are foolishly naive. Remember why we fight.  Fight for those who are in your thoughts! Fight so that your families may know Order and Stability rather than Chaos and Anarchy! Fight to avenge our fallen, those brave souls now at rest. Fight for every trooper beside you, your brothers in arms! Do not count the days, do not count the Parsecs, count only the number of Rebels you have killed! This is the cry of your Empire! Death to the Rebellion!
would be cool if you could chose whether you want to force push or force pull doesn't need to be in the game just something cool that i would like added
will all the  heroes and maps from the first game be returning in battlefront 2?
Ok, but if you don't have era specific heros, it's gonna be kinda weird and stupid
If those crates mean micro transactions then I'm going to flip the fuck out
I want to see Gangnam Style and gentleman as an emote
* just bought star wars battlefront and then sees this *\n\nU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!!?
I wish I could play this game - I only have Nintendo consoles, and I'm not interested in buying a PS4 for the one game I would want on it.  I would buy this game on Switch in a heartbeat.  And don't tell me it won't run - if games like Doom 2016 and Wolfenstein 2 are coming to Switch, please don't tell me it can't happen.  I am thankful you're bringing FIFA, but I'm not going to buy it - I'm not into sports games.  Never have been.  Give me Star Wars.
These (allmost) 5 minutes felt like an hour of fun!!!
This is one of the Best vid i've Steen in my life
Now this... this looks good.
Lol he says 20v20 like it's a big deal
The time has come.\n\nExecute Pre-order 66.

4:16 Yoda would absolutely dick on Maul.
Fucking CRATES!!!
Me gusta star wars batterfront 2
A i tak wyjdzie z tego kupa.
Will this game run on my pc ?\nPentium G4400 \nMOBO MSI PRO-D\nGTX 1050 \n8 gb ram\nI just want to play this without crashes. I don't care about graphics
Font colour yellow, brackets need to be rewritten to format
Very good and nice
It looked pretty interesting until you can find them in crates ...mmkay seeya next time EA
I love John Boyega’s voice
Why is not Rex or Fives in the game😭
What u should know about Darth Vader, funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlYNwEWAUoU
What happened to all the game modes on the first one? They should have carried them over as well
the sound design of the shooting, explosions and hits are amazing
who tf is gonna choose rei over maul
Basically a remastered version of the original star Wars battle field 1 which instead of coming out with the newer bf1 they shoulda just came out with this
i almost died when i saw that content!!
I didn't think that i would say this, but this actually looks amazing!
So cross hero gameplay is a thing :/
I want to know if Matt the Radar Technician be added to the game at some point.
I was so happy to hear the game mode galactic assault and then they said 20vs20.\nWhere is the old version where you could split screen, choose between the empire or republic and duke it out across the universe taking planets and destroying your friends fleet in space...\nplayers of the originals will understand what I mean, although there is more content here I really hope that EA could throw this game mode back in.
Game could be good but it isn't! Same shitty system like the first one and like bf one as well! Why could EA not saty with the old battlefront? Or like bf3?
This is Star Wars Battlefront Two, where we give you features the originals had ten years ago and pretend we're being innovative
Boy the compression took a hit LMFAO
People talking about “free dlc”.... you forgot they’re adding micro transactions to make up for that money?
Ps4 footage my ass. The particles and textures are beyond ps4 can handle. I doubt this will even match final version.
Bet your tits I'm playin heros vs villains all day everyday
EA......... this looks pretty badass so far.......... SO PLEASE DON'T FUCK THIS UP AND MAKE IT A GREEDY DLC FEST LIKE THE LAST GAME.
The pay to win is strong in you young Battlefront 2...
So fucking hot I'm excited
Kylo ren...  i honestly think they screwed up the whole entire series adding him
I'm trying not to get my hopes up lol
I know I wasn’t the only one that had GOOSE bumps
I don't think enough people are talking about how Heros and Ships and stuff are not randomly places on the map now. The better you play the more youll be a hero, which is how it SHOULD be.
EA should've added Tr-8r as a hero character
Every time obi wan spawns he better be saying Hello there or this game fails
Why not galactic conquest smh that was am amazing part of the old ones, bring it back!
I was so happy watching this, then they mentioned loot boxes. Then I remembered this is EA.
Can you play the single player campaign with a friend?
This video just convinced me to pre order this game. Where are my pants? Lol 😂
There are levels of rarity in star cards - Ayy my favorite
EA, I can almost hear Bakers voice as the clones. EA, why not Morris? EA?! IS IT BAKER OR MORRIS?!!
This game shouldn't be getting hate, because they fixed everything and listened to their fans. This game looks EPIC!!! Definitely buying... when the price goes down a bit ( probably after a month or two XD ) But i definitely recommend you buy this game!!!
No matter how good this game is, some people will hate it just because it’s EA.
This made my nuts wet.
When EA wanna bump up the hype train but you don't wanna get dissapointed yet:\n\nI'm one with the force and the force is with me, I'm one with the force and the force is with me, I'm one with the force and the force is with me.....
They better of gotten rid of that bitch ass shield that completely destroyed the fun out of the first one. you'd be seconds away from killing someone and that motherfucker would activate that shield and run off into the sunset as you get killed trying to claim that kill.
Will it be on Steam?
I want to take Yoda, my favourite character
Good but until lightsaber combat gets better than what they showed us I ain't buying
new star wars mmo with these graphics <3 <3
I swear if they don't nerf the Scattergun
Political Correctness shit plus the space fights looks like the planes are all just gliding too damn slow.
There is no R2B2 engaged in assisting the battle, this isn't worth playing.
Cant wait to play this\nI hope EA makes this the battlefront game we all can enjoy and get so much satisfaction from.\n\n really have high hopes for this
instead of finn we could have anakin for the force sake
Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005) still looks and will be vastly better. Fucking lol. 14 maps.\n\n\n\n*1 4*\n\n\n\n*L o l*\n\nInstant action?\n*No.*\nGalactic conquest?\n*No.*\nMods?\n*No.*\nSingle player campaign that's actually likeable and not cookie cutter?\n*No.*\nGood game? \n*You bet your ass not.*
Let me guess... DLC...More DLC...Mirco-Transactions... Even More Mirco-Tranactions...spending $150 for an incomplete game that requires me to purchase DLC.... I doubt this BattleFront 2 will beat the Original...
Damn, this game looks crisp. It brings new life into Star Wars
There are so many Sith and Jedi from the expanded universe you could add in the game and you edgy phase Kylo ren
Can people who bought Battle Front 1 please get a discount or some reward for buying this one?
but CAN you get IN and OUT of the vehicles? and transport friends in 2 person ships?
Love This game I played The first one Amazing.. BUT IT'S MISSING a few things that would take this game to the next level.  LIKE CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION AND It Would be nice to be able to keep your level from SWB Pt. 1 AND EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO LEVEL UP AND BECOME A BOUNTY HUNTER, JEDI OR SITH WITH YOUR CHARACTER JUST SAYIN.
We've captured the command post! That's all I want to hear
Right, but how does this compare to Star Wars Battlefront 2?\n\nThat's the question everyone really wants answered.
EA u call this a game?!?\n\n\n\n\n\nI call it a masterpiece
Looks absolutely amazing!!\nIm speechless!!!!! \n(Like if u agree)!
2:29 You just cant have nice things
Finally a game where they focus on the villains and not the good guys even tho I think the dark side is way better than the light side who agrees
Nothing pisses me off in these kinds of comments sections then 10 year old's bragging about how they and all their friends pre-ordered the most expensive edition.  They are constantly disappointed by horrible games, but they never stop.
Quick question, do Banthas count as vehicles?
Wow
And singleplayer hah?
WE NEED MORE
p2w?
This is unrealistic but I want the following heroes after DLC...\nAnakin\nObi-wan\nPadme\nMace Windu\nYoda\nAhsoka\nCaptain Rex\nDarth Maul\nCount Dooku\nGeneral Grievous\nJango Fett\nAsajj Ventress\nSavage Opress\nCad Bane\nLuke\nLeia\nHan Solo\nChewbacca\nLando\nNien Nunb\nJyn Erso\nDarth Vader\nPalpatine\nBoba Fett\nGreedo\nBossk\nDengar\nKrennic\nRey\nFinn\nPoe\nKylo Ren\nPhasma\nHux
Wymagania? Jakie sa wymagania!

FIX THE BOTS
Cuando aprenden de los errores del pasado
Like si querías que hubiesen mas de 100 unidades en la batalla como antiguamente
Another female protagonist.. For fucks sake.
It's a prequel guys they had Dutch in the trailer
Van der Linde was a side character that wasn't as important as Bill Williamson or Javier Escuela.\n\nAlllllrighhhht, then...
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info
When is bully 2 coming i am excited about that ☺
magnificent 7 was a great movie
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?
For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3.
Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
I seen this trailer
Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.
yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
I swear this game better then the GTA series
Is it for PC though.?
This is what happens when you put two idiots in charge..
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
It's just a cut scene of cowboys eating at camp, this is how games get hyped beyond all reason, rockstar games or not.
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
It's comes out in auttum
there was a morality system in red dead redemption
Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer
Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
lol Marty was all over the place in this video
I can finally hang myself in peace.
I really hope it’s not all online
That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
How did they not recognize Dutch
I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game.
Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
yo I cant wait for it
No game no hype, those are the rules.
Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April.
hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters...
He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you...
“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol
Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
I only care about multiplayer!
can preorder now. o yeah were close
throwing my money at the screen, want to pre-order, but can't find it on STEAM????????????
are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
it could be as late as june.
I'm betting and hope one of the  main characters is a the native american with the rag sack.
THE HYPE TRAIN is gone!!!! this is a must!!!
Marty's hands keep shaking, is that hype?
I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking.
How will they work shark cards into this...
Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much
Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
DID YOU HAVE TO PUT A TIMER IN THE BEGINNING
The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day
Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
Best open world game ever Coming right up
RDR2 will look and play best on Xbox One X!\nStay tuned, pc to run this @ 0p & 0fps.
Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of..
any players who havent played rdr but likes cowboys?
Coming 2019
I'm playing this on Xbox one X can't wait
I want gta 6
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2
In-depth horse relationship   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
WTF? there wasn't sound!
No black characters?
PC please
Yeah!!!
downgrade ?
pc someone?
Amateurs....
great hype much erection
DUTCH VAN DER LINDE jeez
no sound?? beautiful
Wow 1 hour stream for 1 min trailer ggwp idiots
This is how uncreative IGN is
Fully torqued
PC?
omg can`t wait
The baddest mofo in red dead is still Juan Sierra: Quien quiere peleyar con migo!
K
Hyped
What's interesting from both trailer's is the wild life. They seem to have their own eco system where they'll hunt, feed, dehydrate etc. In Red Dead 1 the animals will just stand there and any predators will hunt you and nothing else. But in Red Dead 2 trailer The predators look as though they'll will hunt & kill other prey as well as your self. What's more interesting is the way this new eco system will impact on your horses. Do they get hungry, thirsty or even die of natural causes? Cos' maintaining your horse is a whole new gameplay mechanic not encountered before and will be very interesting to see in game.
Was that captured on a high-end PC? I'd love if it did, but I doubt it'll look like that on my PS4.
You guys are literally oblivious lol that was a younger Dutch in the trailer so this is going to be a prequel and you can bet that john is going to make an appearance
I can't wait for the multiplayer coop that we just couldn't get right in GTA\n*SOMEBODY WANTS TO JOIN YOUR POSSE*
That man with the magnificent mustache is Dutch motherfuckin Van Der Linde.
Will this have shark cards??! I WANNA BUY A COTTON FARM
I AM\nHYPED FOR THIS 👀🤓
How stupid are these guys! That politician is Dutch, the leader of the gang!!! ARGHHH And its definitely a prequel!
If you're the supposed experts that are going to analyze the trailer how about at least reading the synopsis of the first one on the wiki? 😑
We don't know if it's a prequel Young Dutch was in the trailer you dopes...
How did these guys not hear him say Always Dutch.
It's a prequel guys they had Dutch in the trailer
Van der Linde was a side character that wasn't as important as Bill Williamson or Javier Escuela.\n\nAlllllrighhhht, then...
My god, this rampant speculation is why people always get over-hyped and are ultimately disappointed in games. Temper your expectations, people. I get it, you're excited, but let's be a little realistic here.
Seriously? We knew it was a prequel when they showed us the first trailer.
Wow. You really know nothing. Of course it is a prequel and from the trailer it is crystal clear that it is. Do you prepare for such a show at all?
Just look to the right the trailer has already been released
Watching this while in a lecture session lol
Will the be available on the Sega Genesis?
Wow only fuckin 6 months because of delay...... smh rockstar
hey ign your description says its a sequel LMAO ITS PREQUEL
what an abysmal analysis. took them like ten minutes to realize who dutch is and that its a prequel. and they only found out because chat told them... pretty pathetic
I feel like the kid in the trailer is john and this character, Morgan, will at several points cross paths with John. I think this new character is gonna betray Dutch at some point and maybe Marston will be the guy that kills him.
Only real ones watch the entire 24 min loading screen
Rockstar isn't EA or Ubisoft.\n\nHype
Off topic but does anybody know any good STD clinics around?
Tom Sellick character   ? thats Dutch and he was the main villain ...did you guys even play the game?
They are so good at covering games that they do'nt remember Dutch, and that he is old in RDR, and here we see Dutch way younger, so props to IGN for being so good at seeing everything but the obvious...
“Morgan” calls the man at the end “Dutch” I’m presuming Dutch Vanderlin.....
YOU GOT SOME MONEY FOR ME BOY
stil not on pc
hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
Dutch Van der Linde was anything but a minor character. He was the leader of Dutch's gang and John Marston's boss before the original Red Dead Redemption.
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
Can we have Indians in this one
You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought
Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info

Dutch looks like he’s about to be a damn good antagonist...
I was hoping for\nSpring 2018 but to tide you over Red Dead Redemtion remaster this holiday for Ps4, Xbox One, Switch and PC!
If I cant climb up or paraglide off that cliff, i wont buy!
AT LAST\nIVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
But they already released the new trailer....?
I want a GTA5 style online game where you can ride with your posse and do co op bank heist's and train robberies. Cant wait for this game, wish it was out before Christmas.
Is it just me or does the badass stab lady look like bonnie mcfarlane from rdr?
I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking.
How will they work shark cards into this...
Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much
Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
Is it for PC though.?
it's not north or south dakota, or montana, or literally anywhere you listed because none of those places are the WEST.
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?
For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3.
Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
I seen this trailer
Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.
yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
I swear this game better then the GTA series
yo I cant wait for it
Marty's hands keep shaking, is that hype?
DID YOU HAVE TO PUT A TIMER IN THE BEGINNING
The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day
Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
Best open world game ever Coming right up
Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of..
When you skip the guys talking and just watch the trailer. Can't wait for this game!
Please god no character switching
I think the woman is Annie Stokes from Red Dead Revolver!
Watching theses two grasp at straws try to gleam anything from a one minute trailer is ridiculous
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2
It has to be a prequel because dutch is in the end !!!!!!
WTF? there wasn't sound!
PC please
any players who havent played rdr but likes cowboys?
Coming 2019
wow clueless
I want gta 6
Dislike because IGN
In-depth horse relationship   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The baddest mofo in red dead is still Juan Sierra: Quien quiere peleyar con migo!
They took different Wild West spots. When they came to Santa Fe NM they are using the old building there is

Yo
TIME TO UPGRADE THE PC!
i have to fart
What's interesting from both trailer's is the wild life. They seem to have their own eco system where they'll hunt, feed, dehydrate etc. In Red Dead 1 the animals will just stand there and any predators will hunt you and nothing else. But in Red Dead 2 trailer The predators look as though they'll will hunt & kill other prey as well as your self. What's more interesting is the way this new eco system will impact on your horses. Do they get hungry, thirsty or even die of natural causes? Cos' maintaining your horse is a whole new gameplay mechanic not encountered before and will be very interesting to see in game.
Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.

This is what happens when you put two idiots in charge..
It's just a cut scene of cowboys eating at camp, this is how games get hyped beyond all reason, rockstar games or not.
It's comes out in auttum
there was a morality system in red dead redemption
Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer
Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
lol Marty was all over the place in this video
I can finally hang myself in peace.
I really hope it’s not all online
That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
How did they not recognize Dutch
I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game.
Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about.
No game no hype, those are the rules.
Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April.
hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters...
He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you...
“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol
Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
I only care about multiplayer!
can preorder now. o yeah were close
throwing my money at the screen, want to pre-order, but can't find it on STEAM????????????
are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
it could be as late as june.
I'm betting and hope one of the  main characters is a the native american with the rag sack.
hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
Is it for PC though.?
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info
When is bully 2 coming i am excited about that ☺
magnificent 7 was a great movie
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?

You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.

The same as in the home town, but only available in builders hall.\nIt will be a good way for players to test their builder bases with friends before taking on the world...\n\nLike if you agree...

Dear Clash of clans\n\n     There's a bug inside of the game.In the news says the battle machine can be upgraded to level 15 but I saw in the top players their battle machine was level 20.
I like this game
Godson still has the best style though!
Supercell there should be an option to buy another super builder
How do they matchup against each other on builder base?
Now I am hall 7

pokedex is wrong, god is dead, the goverment is fucked, thanksgiving is about killing indains
Analyze Entei please.
do something on Volcarona.
Debunk Dugtrio.
mew
Ditto please
hueta
LMAO.. So, it's pretty much like the bible, of all things!!
I'm conflicted. On one hand I wanna see an arcanine episode, since he's my favorite, but I don't wanna have him ruined for me...
A random thought... If Ditto has a set mass(mass can't be created), his weight shouldn't be able to change when he takes the form of a larger Pokemon, then a plain Ditto should have the same weight and mass as a Ditto that takes the form of a Snorelax. \n\nNow Here's a question! How large of a pokemon or object would Ditto have to transform into, until his density, is less than the air around him, and he begins to float? \n\nPlease upvote, I'm curious about this one...
Pretty sure every Poke-tuber on Youtube has done at least one video covering this exact subject matter.
15 mins on black holes and y a Pokémon can't make one.
How about the Pokédex entry for Magcargo? It claims that it is 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit which would make it literally impossible for normal humans to even get near the thing without immediately frying to death. Also, the entries aren't written by the professors. They, instead, have children go out and collect their data for them which seems extremely unprofessional and thus, could lead to tons of misinformation within the dex. Misinformation that, as far as we know, the professors never bother to check and fix.
Legit \nHello everybody want to get free stuff download Verydice and start rolling use my code 1177158
Hey matpat, MATPAT! STAT! So we have the pokedex, right? And we, a ten year old kid are filling it out, NOT the professors so basically we're writing the entry's therefore making things up because, say we see a gardevoir use shadow ball and immediately think it's a black hole?
Magearna plase...realy: How da heal does that thing moves?!?!?
Honestly would love to see Eevees or hell maybe one of the alolan pokemon?
What if pokemon is magic and they is no science to it.\nWhat if pokemon have inner power that can create and control energy.
My one point of contention with your reasoning on this MatPat is that you assume the black hole has to be stable. More than likely the black holes it would use as attacks are meant to strike quickly, (most likely within a fraction of a second, since while they're turn based in game, Pokemon battles are generally shown to be relatively fast paced in the show), before dissipating. This would allow it to attack and deal severe damage to its opponent, without going to the incredibly ridiculous lengths necessary to create a stable black hole. Not saying your information about black holes or your research is incorrect, but rather that you're not considering the practical application of how it would attack with said black holes. Still a good episode over all, and I'm looking forward to more as there are a lot of entries that make little sense, but I did have to point out my personal disagreement with your over all conclusion on this one......
HAHAHAHA I just noticed you are using the Kerbal Space Program soundtrack! Nice choice for a space episode!
Wouldnt its hug kill you via the massive red spike on its chest
Matpat: the Pokedex is full of lies\nme: click\nMatpat: just 1 example
Black holes are product of scientists imagination.
5:30  “Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.”
Your setting yourself up for failure in another video. Then you won't have the pokedex to lean on for backup evidence
Soundtrack sponsored by kerbal space program. Is there a game theory on that coming?
Moltres like how does the fire stay alight when moltres is flying super fast
heres the first thing. Pokemon is fictional, it doesnt always need to follow every real life law of physics
Or maybe gardeviour creates something that can suck in stuff, but isn't a black hole, and they just call it a black hole.
Be nice to my creepy Wisp Monster, MatPat! She's sensitive...\n\nAnyways, what about Swampert? Towing yachts at jet ski speeds seems a bit far fetched for the guy, right?
came for the pokemon, stayed for the science.
Matty Patty you're forgetting one very important thing. The pokedex isn't written by the professors, but by the 10 year olds they give them to. That's why if your character only sees a Pokemon but doesn't catch it only the picture and some very limited (basically nothing) information is added. Its only when the trainer catches the Pokemon that the entry is filled out. Its not lies, but the limited knowledge (see myths and lore) and over active imagination of a 10 year old trainer. I'm disappointed in you Pattycakes, you're better than this.
Who came first: Arceus or Mew?
But i cant read D:\n\nIf you are wonderong, lies means read that in german.\n\nOh and btw, no one is mentioning that Mat is doing   scientific theorys again?
I think the keywords are psychic power. Maybe it's psychic power are dense enough to create a black hole. Don't forget it's a while different universe so not everything is the same as it is in ours.
Wait the dex is filled by the trainers so perhaps that pokemon is just using shadow ball or dark big bang attack and the trainer being just a kid doesn't know any better.
Trust me, grab nearly ANY ghost type Pokemon and you have one creeypasta filled episode. Like Yamask (It's mask is it's former human face.) or even Phantump (The soul of a child that died in the woods and then possessed a tree.).
10:21 if black holes absorb light how are you reading this
Can you do a theory on doraemon especially of bamboo copter and anywhere door
4:00 there is no such thing as black light bouncing into your eye. Black is the absence of color, where a material partially absorbs light. It just so happens that black holes absorb all light. If black holes were invisible, we'd be able to see straight through them.
The catch is that It was admitted that black holes don't actually exist, given that any amount of matter smashed into such a small space would begin to rotate, and the smaller it got, the faster it would rotate, until the kinetic force of the spin was pushing just as hard as the gravity was pulling, causing it to simply rotate infinitely. Therefore, black holes don't actually exist. At best they make certain mathematical problems possible, but that's about it.
uhhh question: what if gardevoir could compress the mass of something small (similar mass to a bullet) inside the danger whatever it may be?\nsure it would quickly evaporate but in the fraction of a second that it would exist it could burn the danger away (altough I know nothing about black holes so maybe I'm wrong)\nor I don't know... gardevoir could compress THE DANGER ITSELF! once again it would evaporate, but that would work in the trainner's favor would it not?
The moon could NOT become a stable Black Hole.\nTo become a Black Hole and stay stable you need 2 things:\nMass (around 150x our sun)\nAnd a supernova that crushes that mass into a space as tiny as a tennisball. \nYou cant create a black Hole that can stay alive out of sth as small as the moon or 20x our sun my friend :P
Can you do a book theory of the Jedi order book series the yusa vong Wars please it’s a Star Wars book please
So gardevor is the most usless pokemon but could also be the most devistating to the earth...........................i might go live on the sun now ( this is the year 8099)
What if it makes a black home out of the other Pokemon? It would immediately disintegrate and stop the threat. OR it could use a black hole made from air, causing an effect kind of similar to cavitation (that thing that makes mantis shrimps so powerful) not to mention suffocation or collapsed lungs.
Just saying, but the Pokedex says that Gardevoir will give its own life for its trainer. Meaning that Gardevoir still does its job(sort of, at the expense of everything on planet Earth).
Good. Thank you. Now I have a more recent account where you admit you are human and that you make mistakes for that plethora of idiots who keep pretending that theory is a shield to pretend you are always right.
The liar here is you! The Pokedex isn't written by the Professors, it's empty when you get it. They task YOU with filling it in! Oak says he is too old to go and do the research himself, so you have to find all the Pokémon and report back
7:57 Our house... In the middle of our house-
hey thanks for making a pokemon video is my birthday and i em pokemon crazy so thank you hoop to see and here moor from you love you
I dont see any problem with the smaller black holes that fizzle out? That says nothing against the dex entry.
Pokemon Sun and Moon? You could continue the multiple universe theory!
Woah, that Aladin reference is actually a perfect way to quickly sum up black holes, props for that Matt! How did you even make the connection?
Smh I hate when American debunk anime logic. You just don’t.
Applying real world physics to psychic energy which doesn't exist in the real world....ok
The music you put in your videos scare me
50hrs of gameplay per game? haha, no
I am a simple man.\nI see a reference to Hitchhiker guide to the galaxy, I upvote
Don't you think that the ONE AND ONLY EXAMPLE you put forward speaks more towards its psychic strength rather than the black holes it self? After all being able to compress matter with only the power of your mind, much like your jokes and over all humor, is no laughing matter.
Should of looked at Macargo the lava snail or regice the really really cold.
The definition said nothing about needing matter, just a gravimetric force.
It could always crush the threat into a tiny black hole
Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell: What if there was a black hole in your pocket?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ\n\nA micro black hole with the mass of a coin, would evaporate in an explosion comparable to a nuclear bomb.
If you're going to say that the first law of thermodynamics applies to Pokémon, you're gonna have a bad time. The Pokémon universe is clearly one that fundamental physics doesn't apply in.
I really hate your voice........
How is this title not clickbait?
I don't see the lie here?\nthere is obviously a middle ground it's not either the moon or a micro pebble\nfirst you need to Quantify the weight of that Pokemons average Psychic power as that is the units that are being expended here\nin order to do that Mattpat needs to go all death battle with the pokemon in question and i'm uncertain that the information is readily available in universe
MATPAT ALL OF YOUR POKEMON THEORIES SUCK GIANT GREAT BALLS!! PLEASE STOP MAKING POKEMOM BASED VIDEOS
I like your death note reference
i was hoping for it to be more about the pokedex and more pokemon, not 1 pokemon :(
1:23 ...the Pokedex, this pocket encyclopedia... I'm gonna' have to stop you there, MatPat. It's not an encyclopedia at all! If it were, it would be called the Pokepedia! Instead, it's a PokeDEX. Why? Because it's a Pokemon index! Indexes are informal collections of information designed to give a general knowledge of a given subject. Thing is? An index isn't held up to anywhere near as high a standard as an encyclopedia. If the author of the index chooses to do proper research and find the real truth about things, all the better, but it is nowhere near required. Which is why some 'dex entries for Exeggcute claim it to be a cluster of eggs, while others say it is merely MISTAKEN for eggs frequently, when the truth is they're more like seeds. Mistakes like the former are acceptable in an index.
Wait... if black holes produce radiation,  if radiation has mass... wouldn't it be pulled back into the black hole
The concept of black hole radiation contradicts the concept of black holes themselves. Enough gravity that light cannot escape. No mass can escape that gravitational pull, therefore radiation from a black hole is absolutely impossible. It's a logical impossibility for both of those concepts to be true.
something my friend explained to me, all of the entries in the poke'dex could just be nothing more than folklore, not an actuality. in the universe of pokemon, the pokemon themselves have been around a lot longer than the dex and considering these creatures are magical, there's a good chance the characters would have stories and legends about the them. sure the professors were the ones to have made the dex, however they themselves never once say they saw these creatures doing some of these really creepy things, and if they did, they're monsters especially in the case of Driftloon
Do giratina (it would probably be interesting) 😉😉
Victini's infinite energy that its Pokédex entries reference cannot actually be infinite. How can you actually fit an infinite energy source into a body with finite volume, let alone one about the size (and indeed, mass) of a Pikachu? Even taking into account the famous Einstein equation E = m*c^2, you would get a whole bunch of potential energy, so certainly enough to make the Tepig's attack overkill even against a Pokémon against which it has a type disadvantage (which I at least think is Samurott), but it's still a finite figure.
Ya know MatPat you say black holes are really dense. You're right. I did this as a science project at school. Black holes are INFINITELY dense!
Can you please analyse Deoxys? In the Pokedex is written something about a Virus.
I love all the references in this video, especially gmm and the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy reference
Matpat, you need to up your Hawking game :). Ultra small black holes are extremely deadly as they convert their entire mass into energy crazy fast.  A 5gram black hole would create a bigger blast than a nuke... many nukes in fact.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8nHBGFKLHZQ\n\nYou can also create black holes without needing great amounts of mass, check out a kugleblitz, basically a black hole created with extreme amounts of light.
You do a debunk on Blastoise and the Cannons on it's back

... what if the big issue is the Pokedex isn't written by the Professors, but by the 10 year old trainers that they are given too... that is part of your job in the first pokemon game, fill the Pokedex...
Black holes ARE NOT invisible. For something to be invisible light must freely pass through it. You would see a blackhole. When you walk into a pitch black room you don't call everything in the dark room invisible.... you call it dark.... like you can't see anything because your eyes are unable to spot light.... Seeing a blackhole would be the same. Not to mention the light bending around the blackhole would be insanely bright. Quasars and blazars are some of the brightest things in our universe.
Guys every video thumbnail on this channel with the game theory logo has matpat in it!
I think that even if those mini black holes that Gardevoir creates, evaporates quickly, they last long enough to protect their trainers from certain projectiles
Let me stop you there at 1:57 you're already wrong it's not a main source of information in the games manga and anime pokedex's are rare and only handed to certain people only the protagonist has one in each. Youngster Joey doesn't have a pokedex. None of the champions even refer to a pokedex except Cynthia
Whether you believe in the validity of IQ ratings or not, I've always questioned the servitude of an Alakazam and it's intelligence quotient of over 5000 (which has nothing on black holes or ability to distort time and space OR....)
You didn't say that Gardevoir's spike thing will impale u if u hug it
this is the pokemon world, where physics is different than what we know.
1) How comes he didn't mention the rule 34?\n\n2) Darumaka. Do Darumaka next.
Renucleus. Just analyse if it is possible to exist.
The real question is how is trubbish alive it literally is a bag of rubbish
Why is this stupid idiot talking about black holes for a Pokemon video so stupid talk about running out of content
What if gardavoir extually uses its psychic abilitys to hold it stable and in place
Quick note: The professors don't do their own research. The children they gives pokedexes to so the research.
Gen 3 for Pokémon go confirmed
This is just one of the many pokedex entries you could say the same thing about XD
The eeveelutions if that's haw u spell it 😃
Came to hear about the multiple lies in the Dex.\n\n\n\nGot a fifteen minute lesson about black holes and one pokemon lol.
How do z-moves and/or mega evolution work
Where is my doctor who part 3 matpat
let's be honest we all know why he covered gardevoir
I would love to see you make a Theory about Warframe's lore.
He does know that the pokemon can use psychic ability doesn't he ?
I already knew this as fact. Time for the extra dark detail about it!\n\n\n\n\nBut accually tho luv ur content
Im sorry but this is not a hate comment but this isnt eveb about the pokedex its about blackholes....
I read the black hole because I used the pause button😐 derp 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
also Gardevoir can freaking eat your dreams, so I bet it could use that power to at least pull up 2 chunks of the earth, squish them together, and create a black hole lasting at least a couple seconds, using it to protect it's trainer!
rhyhorn, how its bones are 1000x harder than human bones
Sorry MatPat. Austin already does The Science!
There are pokemon like yamask who apparently where at one point humans according to the pokedex but this has some holes like how are there human ghosts if they become pokemon when they die?and how do they even know that these pokemon were humans?
But matpat, that's just one pokemon,  not all pokemon can have wrong information on them, right?
Before watching this theory, here is my theory that I really believed for a long time. In the Pokemon games, the pokedex entry that you gain after catching a new pokemon is so inaccurate, it could only be written by a certain 10 year old. I believe that the entries are written by the player on the spot without any prior research. This explains the stupid descriptions like Charmander's tail and the terrible measurements. Wailord's weight per volume puts him as being as dense as hot air balloon.
How does a squirtle- Blastoise hold so much water in them? Can someone explain?
Here is voice acting for the intro!!   Destroyed all of your child hood fnaf was made up of dead children,solved everything in gaming,and was mostly right!!!!da da da!!!😆
You just debunked your Antman can destroy the world theory.
In theory , f=m(g)/r^2. So so even if you squeeze 2 atoms together to a point where it is small enough that it can collapse on its own gravity , Ta-da , mini backhole. \n Also note that hawking radiation is caused by vacuum fluctuations.  \nNote 2, note that is failed to maintain its gravity to stay together , release energy \nE=mc^2 lama
But you ignored the whole it uses psychic energy to create the black hole it, out right stated the creation technique which can be interpreted to mean that it uses its psychic energy to condense the mass but it could also mean that it creates one out of pure psychic energy which would be a completely different entity then a black hole but may be explained best by using a black hole as an example. Also I think it should be acknowledged that true psychic abilities are not necessarily covered by science so its hard to say what rules of the physical world it obeys and follows gardevoir may create a true black hole of mass but through psychic energy be able to ignore its gravity and manipulate how the force acts on its environment like how we are able to direct a vacuum cleaner it may be a tool she can use.\n\nJust curious about your thoughts on this? Still love the show though.
Hello Matt, I know you often read the comments on your videos, and I really hope you read this one too. This is my first comment ever, and the reason I chose to make this my first comment is because of the videos you made on fake news. They changed my perception on the world and helped me realize that things aren't always as they seem. I'm new to your channels, but since I discovered them I've pretty much marathoned 'em. What I'm trying to say is that you're content is great, and I hope you continue to open peoples eyes. Good luck and God speed.
4:22 Me: You missed an opportunity to make an Interstellar reference 10 seconds later Yyeeeeessss
If black holes absorb light, how are you reading this? - lol nice one (10:22)
But what if Gardevoir makes the opponent into a black hole?
I know that this one video is just covering what the description but... gardevoir (in the anime since a player can choose different moves) normally has shadow ball. so its probably referring to that in a tall tale.
arceus coming out of an egg and then being king of pokemon
Yes but assuming Gardevoir's telekinetic powers are formidable enough, wouldn't it be possible for it to create a black hole within its opponent? My logic is that even though this black hole would last at most 10^-27 seconds, it could still do lots of damage within a body instead of a vacuum like in the particle accelerator.
The pokedex is still in Beta, \nevery game the professor mentions that you and a few more trainers are trialing it. \nThat's why it's your job is to complete the pokedex.
Did mat pat straight up call the 10 commandments bull
wait what ? Black holes produce heat ? ludicrous, where do you get your info really ?
hey matpat can you make another video on fnaf or bendy and the ink machine ?
Please do the Jesus Pokemon, pleaseeeeee or dialga, idk one of the Legendary Pokemons and I'll be Satisfied 150% still i'll  be pleased mat （＾ω＾）
Gotta give points on that Hitchhikers reference game theory.
There should be a theory of krabby actually being a mantis shrimp and not a crab since mantis shrimps create cavitation bubbles which have a strong similarity to in the cartoon where krabby signature attack is bubble beam
You're making a big deal out of this.
I think a better much more accepted theory about the pokedex's inaccuracy is that it's written by 10 year olds. The plot of the games is you collect data on pokemon via your pokedex which then fills itself out. If you look at some of the entries they obviously seem written by a child. Check Alakazam for a good example.
Something on how arceus is the god of Pokemon despite mew being the first Pokemon would be awesome.
it could just make the black hole out of the danger so yah
Soooo.... what I'm gathering is that Thor's hammer is heavier... than a microscopic black hole with the mass of a moon? Tbh I have no honest why I thought of that. I'm stupid. If you had my twelve year old mind, you're understand.
Imagine if Wikipedia was full of lies.\n\n\n\n\n\nLol
You should do how deadly would it be to fall off rainbow road
Please do the fake pikachu one that would be great!
torterra ! hey mat pat how does it have a tree at its back. like so as he could see
Dear matpat, Just a quick question, with fnaf4 is it possible the stuffed toys we see disappear at the end of the game are in the box at the end of the game we cant open, if you think about it, it kinda makes sense but i dont know if this has already been covered already, please like this so Matpat can see because i really want to see this covered
Here's a Pokemon MatPat could do: Magcargo. Mainly because of it's Pokemon Sapphire entry: Magcargo's body temperature is approximately 18,000 degrees F. Water is vaporized on contact. If this Pokémon is caught in the rain, the raindrops instantly turn into steam, cloaking the area in a thick fog.
Bulbasaur, please, I want to make sure my favorite Pokemon is perfect. Please.
Your eyes perceive little to no light as black, so by not seeing anything  you are seeing black. It's like saying that you are seeing nothing, so it's not nothing, it is invisible.
Maybe her psychic powers can make that the black hole not emit radiation

Maybe they meant to say that it can manipulate gravity around it rather than creating a black hole. It would make more sense that way since there are pokemon and moves that deal with manipulating gravitational pull on themselves and their opponents
Gardevoir could just compress the object/creature imposing danger on its trainer into a blackhole, which would be too small and immediately fizzle into the air as hawking radiation.
Yeah okay, the black hole thing is incredibly silly, but the amount of Rule 34 on that thing is absurd!!\n(Semi-)Joking aside, I'll never understand pokemon titles. Like Gardevoir being the Embrace pokemon when [a] no dex entry ever really explains that, and [b] it has that spiky-heart-crystal-doodad on its chest. I always assumed it would have to be soft, like fleshy, otherwise... well the internet is full of embrace jokes.\nAnother one that leaps to mind is Arcanine being the Legendary pokemon. What makes big-ol' hellhound legendary?
I got that hitchhikers guide to the galaxy reference with the wale and flower
But what if a cubic metre of air (mass ~1.3kg) was condensed into a black hole in the centre of an attack. It would have a lifetime of 1.8*10^-16 seconds, but could surely disrupt the attack velocity, energy, etc. If not, the movement of air would also affect the attack, disrupting it in some way. If it compressed 10 cubic metres of air, the black hole would have a lifetime of 1.8*1^-13 s and even more mass to disrupt the attack. This also isn't considering the heat that would be generated by compressing so much mass so quickly. My point in this argument is that the black hole does not need to be stable to affect the environment and if the description was accurate it would be beneficial not to have a stable black hole as that would destroy the earth as stated. Also there is plenty of mass lying around that could be used, and wouldn't be noticed missing. Although it takes tremendous energy to compress matter past its neutron degeneracy pressure, is there an accurate or reliable scale or description of what psychic powers are? Idk, I thought of this argument and found a calculator online.
The fun of this was soaked by a black hole
But what if Gardevoir used its powers to condense the threat/enemy into a black hole? That would turn out okay, because the black hole would be unstable and simply evaporate, rather than destroying the world.
Please can you do Pikachu?
Two actual Pokedex facts:\nMagcargo. It's literally hotter than the sun.\nAlso one day a kid woke up as a Kadabra. Sounds legit.
And yes they do evaporate extremely quickly but what if you make to many of them ir may be by minute amounts it still takes bacteria and matter of all sorts... all the numbers will add up to a big number.... please think about what your talking about scientists. Dont destroy your own planet.
Have you heard of whats called different universes?
I can't stand these black hole analogies. They're so bad \nI hope he ends up mentioning micro black holes that you can create from two particles mashing into each other which then evaporate to hawking radiation. \nI dunno how a pokemon would want to deal a neither world destroying attack nor an attack that is too small to even notice. There is no black hole size where this would be the case. \nSo yeah Matt you did it. You called BS on pokemon physics. Good job
well he just ruined my favorite pokemon, thanks matpat XD. seriously tho keep up the good work :)
Mat, the FNAF timeline is messed up, cuz the phone guy in the second says there's no doors this time even though the time era is BEFORE FNAF 1. To be honest the whole damn TIMELINE is messed up. Please theory this, or tell me at me Twitter @DukeTheNuke2.
I think wailord would do for a good exposing
11:07 MAT BILL NYE ISN'T A REAL SCIENTIST OMG!!!
Do Rayquaza and how it gets the energy to mega evolve despite not having a trainer and also, how it somehow consumes meteors for energy?
13:19 fun fact as black holes gain mass their density drops
So what if instead of using mass, psychic abilities alone are used to distort the fabric of space (which is from my understanding, those distortions cause gravity) and this distortion causes the same effects as a black hole without the need of any mass? Really would appreachiate feedback here though!
Matpat please do a theory about gravity falls series, it has a lot of mystery to unlock for you <3
A microscopic black hole is what is needed to leap in time in the time drama anime steins gate,maybe the microscopic black hole is used to reverse time although that kills gardevoir in the process since she has to maintain a the black hole for long enough .
Maybe MatPat should do a theory about mega evolution or z-moves or maybe even both like which is superior!
But here is the thing... it's a game.. their black holes don't follow the laws of physics.. \n\nThat said... yah, a lot of stuff in the Dex are just legends and myths added in... and it's more for us players than for the characters.
Didn't Austin already cover this?
When he was talking about black holes, anyone jump to make sure they still had our gravity? 😂
What you forget is that when a black hole completely evaporates it releases a tremendous amount of energy. If a black hole with the mass of a penny were to completely evaporate, it would cause an explosion larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. So, if gardevoir were to create mini black holes she could attack opponents with controlled explosions.
Gardevoir has telekinetic powers. Expending all of its energy, it uses this power to SUSTAIN a black hole. Telekinesis is one of those abilities that is more powerful the better the user understands what they're doing. The Gardevoir knows what it's doing. It's pulling matter from all around it into the black hole, thus sustaining it artificially in a way that natural black holes simply cannot do themselves.\nYour science is right, but your understanding of the game is lacking in this case. A little bit disappointing.
Matpat!! Please do a theory on Duck Season, the VR game. It's mysterious and would be a great episode! Like if you agree and so Matpat can see.
Yes but magic and stuff
wouldnt it still be considered a small blackhole if they compressed the thing that was trying to hurt their trainer? and the attacker would be radiation that would probably stop being radiated and become part of earth again.... and it does say to protect them meaning they might only use this as a last hope type thing as creating blackholes and bypassing the effects of gravity (it does say they dont feel gravity but doesnt mean it wont affect them) they would probably be able to detect human emotion.... and hopefully the emotion of the things that it might need to destroy so it feels bad but....
you don't even need to go that far to prove it wrong: creating a black hole large enough to fit a human would fail at protecting it since said trainer would just get crushed by the presure
Make a video about Entei and if his roars, or a loud enough sound, could make volcanoes erupt.
if there’s is anything about Empoleon , maybe it then ?
I really appreciate the 8-bit horror music.
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Professors in the Pokémon world are dicks.
Isn't the Color black also known as the lack of color, and because a black hole has no light (thus meaning no color) work for a name? Like symbolism or something?
Aren't you overlooking the fact that they can teleport?\n\nWhy bother doing anything with particles to make a black hole when they could potentially just recreate similar spatial distortion withe their phenomenal cosmic mind powers?
your wrong, after the small black hole evaporates it creates an explosion powerful enough to destroy earth.
But Pokémon has no physics\n\n\n\n\n\nU can capture god but can’t burn a tree
Black holes aren't invisible. That's not what invisible means. Or black.\n\nA black hole absorbs all light that crosses it's event horizon. Leaving aside that they arr frequently surrounded by orbiting matter, a more critical point is... They block light!\nThus, if a black hole were to pass in front of something, you would be unable to see through the black hole to the objects behind it.\nThis makes it... Black.\nBlack being the abbsence of colour, or in theory, the absense of visible light.\nPaint cannot ever truly absorb ALL light, but note that the whole point of an object being black as opposed to grey or white is  that it neithrr reflects nor emits large amounts of light. Thus, the less light an object is capable of emitting or reflecting, the closer it is to being truly 'black'.\nFor an object to be invisible however, it has to not be detectable.\nBut a black object held in front of a bright, coloured background is very visible indeed.\nWhat is NOT so visible, is a transparent object, such as glass.\nThus an invisible object would not be one that absorbs or reflects light, but one which transmits it without ever absorbing or distorting any of it.\nNone of which describes a black hole.\nThus, a black hole is indeed black, and not invisible. What renders black holes invisible is trying to look at one against a background with little to no contrast.
But anything can become a black hole just neutron stars is heavy enough to make one about every time earth into a peanut would make a black hole so... aye that's pretty neat
Plz do one about our lord and savior Arceus and the ones more close to him.
Do a game theory on ROBLOX!
10:23 I don’t know
I refuse to accept that the Pokedex entries aren't ALL true ALL the time.
i like the ksp music, noice
Do Arceus THE GOD OF ALL POKEMON
Can Yveltal actually absorb all life on earth if it dies? Is that actually possible?
You have to pay after 2 samples, I would know. \n\nPs. Yandere waifu.
Gardevoir makes a sphere of intense artificial gravity, simulating a black hole.
do alakazam.\nhis pokedex entry.\njust that.\n(about the little kid)
I can read it cuz I'm magic
I feel like Matt really just wanted to make a video about black holes
*radiation has energy which can be converted into mass\nRadiation itself doesn't have mass.
What if Gardevoir would keep on shooting subatomic particles before it disintegrates?
one problem, The move moon blast....
You lost me at conservation of matter.
ok 1 i am at 2:22 right now but as we know research and facts can be debunked as new evedence is presented. Things can be thought right and never re evaluated through time as we have seen in history before... that is until someone actually dose look at it more in depth. The Pokedex is rewriten almost every game meaning new information in the pokemon world is found also meaning they know that this process exists and that the knolage on pokemon would be in a grey area untill a set time that they have cold hard facts figured out which could take many many years. also... blub blub
Where is part 2 of indoctrination theory
Wait! One Pokémon?! The Pokedex tells us Lies about ONE Pokémon and you say its full of it!!\nSorry. Nice Episode, but the Title was a bit misleading.
Um... If that is actually how a black hole works (I've followed up on this part of your theory and even theoretical scientist can't really confirm that is actually how a black hole works), wouldn't the black holes sucking in all the light actually make it black not invisible. Or rather we perceive it as black because everything around it is  bouncing off light and in contrast to that it makes the hole actually look black? If it were invisible we would see through it and in order to see through it but still be there it has to refract some sort of light doesn't it?
Gardevoir just turns the enemy pokemon into a black hole, but good game MattPat.
Black is the absence of light.
Can you do a theory on call of duty zombies storyline
Shadowball looks like a black hole, but obviously isn't because video game logic. Fake news.
Honestly I learned so much about black holes I forgot this episode was about pokemon.
what if gardevoir creates the black hole then hugs its trainer so they wouldnt get sucked in?
Can you do a game theory on Ruby Quest? It's a creepy click and point adventure game found on http://evilcorporation.com.br/rubyquest/ and while it seems like there's a pretty easy meaning to find due to it being connected to the poem The Metal Glen by Willam Murdoch, I'm pretty sure you could find something more than worthwhile.
PLS DO GRENINJA!!!
Empoleon
BOO
Haha kerbal space program music around 7:20
MEWTWO
Use Ratata Next time Pls
Pikapoo
Banette please.  Or really any ghost Pokemon! :D
Plz do Gothitelle

Magcargo is hotter then the sun.
Snorlaxxxxx
WRONG!!!!\n\n\n\nSmall black holes explodes upon Hawking radiation

Do snorlax please!
Magcargo
Do Regigigas
Wut is sience
Steelix
Wow gmm (good mythical morning)
This was awesome, matpat!! My man!! #science #cosmos #mailman
Black holes Matter heh Get it?
Do a Bisharp theory
mantine
Rayquaza
Do ninetails
Rapidash!
10:22 i dont know
Maybe analyze Gallade next?
Here's the thing - if Gardevoir can manipulate singular particals, couldn't it just seriously mess with an object, or person, nearby?\nAs in kill 'em ded, no blackholes required
Analyse Magneton, aside from the fact that their non-biological what kind of magnetism keeps them stuck together? Cuase whatever it is it ain't ferromagnetism as their not pulling in everything that ferromagnetic around them 24/7.
golbat is interesting to me can you please try it
*comments about the next dr who theory*
Loved the Good Mythical Morning reference!
10:22, because its 4 O'Clock and im still on my computer and the light of it is bouncing off it
Ok let me explain something the pokedex is an online encyclopaedia you use in the pokemon manga pokemon adventures at the very moment red gets his pokedex oak says  i want you to find all the pokemon and write down everything you learn about them  on to the pokemon encyclopaedia so then ethier you the trainer finds a legendry and write down what they learn about them and if someone found it before them they can lie but you the trainer can fix it you're welcome.
I would love to hear about mew two and the genetics behind him (since he was created and all that jazz).
How about Magikarp or Alakazam or Magcargo? Or Tyranitar, Charmander getting surfed by water and still not dying from no tail fire
I'm gonna have to call bs. Radiation is light, right? Then how could it actually escape a black hole? I'm personally convinced by the idea that it gives off radiation is nothing more than light slingshot off the black hole's gravity like most science fiction. Otherwise, there are actual particles that are not affected by gravity to any extent.\n\nGuess which one seems more likely, but who am I to reasonably question science.
Is there a reason why Earth physics work for the Poké-verse? It didn't in the Assassin's Creed world! [Leap of Faith - video]. \nAlso can anyone tell me if FilmTheory has created a theory based on the Big Hero 6 portals?
matpat plz do mimikyu or type null I'm so intrigued\ni mainly want to see type null
Oh, who knows creating a black hole as an attack is not possible, so I guess a Squirtle squirting out water obviously way more than its body size is complete fine then? Or basically all psychic attacks, totally scientifically possible, eh?
which POKEMON to analyze next? More like next POKEMON to destroy...
I like how he shows eggman running faster than sonic in the intro
Bad science. This channel's theory, not the Pokedex. Completely lacks understanding of singularities. First, the minimum size and energy of small black hole are not certain. Secondly, assuming the rate of Hawking radiation is as predicted a 70 metric ton blackhole would be stable for about a year, 20 metric tons about a second. Something the mass of the moon would basically last longer than the current age of the universe. Now a micro-singularity weighing about 20 metric tons would still be lethal if not due to gravity due to the radiation released we are talking 389,740 megatonnes of TNT worth of energy in a second. The radiation would definitely kill you and probably everything on the planet. A black hole with the energy of a kilogram of TNT would have a mass of like 0.05 micrograms and only need to last a fraction of a second and could still harm any threat to its trainer. The question would be how the hell does it shield its trainer from the radiation. Also, black holes aren't invisible more like if you could actually see it it would be black since black is the absence of light. Now due to gravity bending light, it would kind of be like a lens bending light around it but I am too lazy to work out the math right now. The reason we can't directly see black holes in space is not because they are invisible but because the accretion disk is basically generating massive amounts of radiation mostly in the form of x-rays and the blackhole itself doesn't directly emit light and absorbs the light headed toward it so there is no way to see it since the empty space also doesn't directly emit light. basically a black body against a mostly black background would be invisible.  But I imagine like a marble on a tablecloth if space had way more stars and empty space was not black these black holes would not be invisible. Meaning if an entity ever made one on a planet it could be visible and probably larger than expected since while the sigularity would be microscoping the well creating the lensing could be significantly larger.
Okay, first off,\nDon't question Pokémon. Anything's possible in the world of Nintendo.\nAnd second,\nIt's actually Shadow Ball. Oh well, whatever.\nAlso, I want myself analyzed, please.
I want to see why wormadons (i think i spelled it wrong)can stick in branches,and what insect does it convey as?
Hey can we get a bloodborne theory?
Do Snorlax please! Weighing up to 1000lbs, needing to eat 900lbs of food EVERY DAY!
Snorlax is gonna kill us all ... right?
new theory\n\ngardevoir is an evil psychopath bent on the destruction of the entire earth. or maybe it does this to save the universe by stopping Mewtwo. just a thought.
Wouldn't you be able to see the black hole because of the things that are far behind the black hole?
Can you plz do a theory on pikmin
I hate this the black holes would immidately die bai hawking radation.
Where in new Zealand are you go to south aukland
What happens if you smash nokias into each other in the LHC?
Kinda dont wana ruin ur rant but did u watch the first episode of pokemon? The pokedex is a prototype that is wrong and very incomplete , there are several pokemon just not in it, and Ash receives it to help complete it , and spoiler ash is an idiot that fights rock pokemon with a pikachu.... Just saying Ash doesnt know what a blackhole is....
The issue is that (according to the Pokedex) Gardevoir uses psychokinetic power to distort dimensions in Sapphire, and psychic power in Black/White. So we know that some kind of psychic power is at play, which deals with the realm of nonexistent forces and magic. If that is the case, then the creation and utility of black holes is possible the moment magic is allowed in the context. Magic can be used to justify any questionable claim. How doesn't the world get destroyed when Gardevoir uses makes a black hole? Magic. Why don't pokemon die when they are hit with extremely powerful attacks? Magic. The mention that Gardevoir is not affected by gravity should have already notified you about the involvement of magic. In our understanding of the universe, nothing is unaffected by gravity. Then what is Gardevoir made of? Perhaps magic? \n\nAlso, your claim that science is lying to us with the term 'black holes' is misleading at best. Yes, the term may be inaccurate for its description, but it is not a lie to have a misleading term. Black holes are a shorthand way to describe these things in space; it's a name. \n\nOh, and the title of the video? FULL OF LIES, you say? You have only made a (questionable) claim about one pokemon's pokedex entry. One out of several hundred pokedex entries is not sufficient to make a FULL OF LIES claim. Perhaps a more accurate clickbait title would be Game Theory: The Pokedex LIES TO US. That title is in line with your claim, which I believe is incorrect anyway. \n\nFeel free to discuss and point out any errors in my thinking. I am happy to admit my wrongs. \n\nTL;DR: \nGardevoir uses psychic power, which is essentially magic. Magic can justify anything, including the use of black holes.
seems like this should've been an Austin episode...
Larvitar and the fact that it eats mountains, maybe?
technically since black holes suck in light you would notice a growing darkness near one as the light is removed forming a shadow, which also means looking away from a black hole would be brighter than looking at one (as looking away from one you would observe the light getting sucked into the blackhole and as a result, in your direction). think of it as a light that emits darkness
please I want to see salamance
Matpat can repeat the same statement so many times in one video that a small black hole will form and suck all my interest away.
Here's a Fire Emblem theory: The Weapon Triangle (Swords beats Axes, Axes beats Lances, Lances beat Swords): Can that it work in real life?
So mewtwo is not the strongest pokemon?
Too nerdy for Game Theory? Ha! NOTHING IS TOO NERDY FOR GAME THEORY!!!
make a threoy about how greninja lost to charizrad
man i love me some POKEYMANS!!!!
I like the little subtleties of these videos of his, like when he said black holes suck in the light an image of Light Yagami from death note went into it.
it's pokemon, who's to say that it is the same world where physics are the same? in the pokemon universe we have creatures that tear time and space, that create worlds,  that can travel travel between universes. you look too deep into a world that could be completely different, for someone who uses the multiverse theory often, you should take this into consideration.
Next time you talk about black holes can you slip in the word Spaghettification ?\nNot sure if I spelled it right but it's supposed to be a homogeneous gravitational field caused by extreme tidal forces, in the most extreme cases, near black holes,the stretching is so powerful that no object can withstand it, no matter how strong its components. Within a small region the horizontal compression balances the vertical stretching so that small objects being spaghettified experience no net change in volume.\nWell it says so in Wikipedia.
can someone just tell pat. its just a game ;'))))))))))))))))))))).
Wikipedia is full of alot of lies don't trust it it can be edited by anyone. 0-0
And then you realize that one of gardevoir's attacks is Moonblast..... throwing a black hole at a pokemon?
Does that mean that Rick in Rick and Morty's portal gun has something to do with black holes? Maybe you could do a theory on that, idk.
Um, the pokedex never states that the black holes are SUCCESSFUL in protecting their trainer. And by the way something that is truly black is literally invisible. Black = the absence of light. There is no such thing as black light.
This video is dumb... like... really dumb... dumb enough for me to think about unsubscribing. Also this video is really padded out which could be 1/2 the time.
Mew; Genesis Supernova, Mewtwo: part human, Blaine is the dad where ditto used to be in the DNA
I think Gardevoir uses their psychic powers to make the small black hole stable
what if gardevoir protect her trainers from them self\nyou know\nhuman cant be trusted with their nature?\nlmew
How is Gardevoir the embrace pokemon? She has a freaking blade coming out her chest!
Also tiny black holes explode with light, so they could be used as a weapon.
If black holes absorb light, how are you reading this?
yes a pokemon video. ps flying types are the best.
Isn't pure black an ABSENSE of light?\n\nAlso, the pokedex RECORDS information AUTOMATICALLY, meaning it's not directly written by the professors.
14:36 that picture is my screensaver!!!!!
This was a cool episode because I was fascinated by black holes and wonder if mega Man 9 black hole bomb would work\n\nCan you please do an episode on the regi trio their Pokedex says their industuctable and is it even possible for ice metal and rock to be so
Wait if we can't see a black hole and they accidentally made one and thier just playing POKEMON GO that means..... We die? And wait how do we disable it or destroy it oh wait we can't destroy..... Wow i hate scientists......
i know im breaking the sixth commanmet but where is the 3rd doctor who?
6:40    Is it just me or does that background music sound like Kerbal Space Program?\n\n\nEdit:\nNo its not just me, went further into the vid, MAOR Kerbal Space Program music.
I love the ksp music
Sometimes we get things wrong on this channel.\n\nA way to reduce this is to play the game first before toughing it. Like TF2, or from what I heard, Undertale when you did the ness is Sans... I still don't see it.\n\nAlso, what's the tech of the Pokemon universe? I assume it's the same as ours but they use Pokeballs that can contain things muuuuuch larger than the ball itself, which can compress... What's to stop the gardevoire from keeping the Black hole contained? and wouldn't a Shadow ball look like a Black Hole? It certainly looks like a void. Everyone knows what a shadow ball looks like but the question becomes, what happens if it's altered slightly. If your creating it with mental powers then you can limit the mass going into it and also pull things into it. Say the thing that's trying to kill the trainer.\n\nPokemon's weird and with physics different than our own, it's going to be tough to judge
i LOVE this into
I want to know how eevee can evolve into all of those types and how the heck that happens? I want answers MatPat!!!
Me : I mean hey, don't fight it too much guys. At least Hypnos/Drowzees don't exist.
yay pennywise was on the balloon
I want that kitty face LEGO block! So cute! :3
The Pokedex is FULL OF LIES!\n\nThere was just one lie tho
1 month into a middle school animation class and I can do all of the animation in your videos lol\nNo offense to ur no talent editors
This video taught me so much stuff that tomorrow when i go to school ima tell my teacher how the pokedex lied to us because HE also plays pokemon
AWESOME!! Please make a discord server to discuss these things! \n\nLike if you agree, you can unlike after tier zoo noticed this as proof of the fact that this is no like bait
goddamn it i love this.
Kinda obvious that black tip reef is the worst, and Mr.Snappy is the best\n\nNobody will get this
Great build analysis!  Going to make sure to show this to someone who is just freaked out by these builds...  But, could we get a Honey Badger build analysis?
Please do a build guide on apes.
Yes omg yes I think I came. Is that meta?
Can't wait for SethTheProgrammer to debunk this
Hey can you address the supposed loc ness build, I've never seen the player but some people have apparently
Can you do invasive species and provide an in game context for their playstyle
playing oceans is so damn boring tbh theyre the biggest maps and basically featureless
This game should just be called Call of Duty. Because when you say the initials you just say... Cod... Hehe
I don't know how you feel about Zerg builds, but at up to 40% of the playerbase/Biomass, Ants need to be acknowledged
Pretty sure Greenland shark gets D and goblin shark gets C
That fact about the 3-D vision for the hammer heads tripled me out.... Also could you do a video on the Dog? Or the housecat?
How come ray's weren't included in this patch
Why is he talking about gameplay Is he trolling ?
That's it, I'm finally subbing. Between the funny editing and informative content, this channel is just great. Thanks for making all the videos!
My favorite shark build got the top of S tier!!!! I feel like I won a prize hahaha
Surely the Gummy Shark makes F tier, Its a smaller, lower stated nurse shark.
Lol I love how you make it sound like it's a video game 🎮
Do a vid on humans
dude do a tier list for  bears
Awesome channel. I'd request you to cover cryptids, but I'm not sure if it is just hearsay or just a very restricted closed beta thing. Severe lack of gameplay footage doesn't help too.
Could you please make a video where you create a random build?
Yo, somebody start working on an animal rpg ASAP! You can use these for reference
Smash mouth defiantly ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

Can we get comparison between the crocodile and alligator builds? Which is better at dominating their respective biomes?
DID YOU JUST MAKE A WOBBLING JOKE! Subscribed.
My favorite shark is the frilled shark, it's older than dirt and looks like it.
I know you didn't just make an entire channel that's stolen from casually explained
Can you do a video on best sleeper builds? (A.K.A best builds that shouldn't work but work extremely well)
Were domestic cats coming or was that just a joke in the video on cats? :-p
What GAME IS THIS??
Whale sharks are one of my favorite animals I love them so much
When are you making a patreon
Hey can you do a vid about Hyenas?
Mako sharks are B at most, They're delicious to humans.
So happy you're getting recognition! Your content is great!
I like this video, because I love Sharks. But some of your facts werent quite right. Such as Nurse Sharks are pretty fierce, they can suck Conchs and SeaTurtles from their shells. And not all shark need to keep moving some species can pump blood over their gills.\nCongrats on all the subs!
as a tiger shark player i often get confused by the human players waste and i eat it thinking it was food
I knew I recognized that song from Fishing Trawler on RuneScape
Dude, you are the channel I've always needed without knowing it.
Will you do a beetle tier list? There's so many guilds.
I feel although the complete removal of Megalodon players/class was completely unwarranted. While yes it would be strong in the current meta it would still have it's weaknesses such as their ease of being team shot. Like if you agree.
Can you discuss the Bat builds?
Where does the Goblin shark place? I wanna start a new aquatic build but I'm not really sure where to start and the Goblin shark has always intrigued me.
I don't think i've subscribed so quickly to a channel.
Is he talking about a game
I think we need a legendary character build video where you cover Bigfoot and all the other mythical builds. Could be fun
Great videos! Can you make a banned tier list video?
What about high tier bird builds
plant tier list!! I know its a simplistic mode but you can play on a toaster
Hey TZ, Do you mind doing a video on humans? Listen I've been a human player for a long time now and their viability is inarguable but lately I've been getting sick of these griefing clans    and their bullshit. It's gotten so bad that I'm honestly considering switching over to Dog, its a much simpler play style. Keep up the good work!
How about a brief overview of each tier?
how am i only now finding this channel ? a really neat approach to categorizing and teaching about different families/ genera/ species of animals !
I remain impressed at how quickly your production quality rises. Great job with the voice editing!
please make more intros like that lol
what game is this
Any plans for anti-meta discussion?
i would also like to mention the great whites cloaking ability. the top of it is painted grey so that players above the shark looking down have a much harder time  spotting it against the black background. this coupled with the great whites power charge and moderate intelligence level (big cat level), boasts the build as a stealth power attacker
What about goblin sharks? Where would you place those on the tier list?
Where can I find the character select screen. Looking to make a stealth build
We have a cat tier list. Dog tier list? I've seen some good dog players in my day. How would you rate the intelligence of the different dogs?
Do one with humans
The runescape references in this video lol, sea shanty 2, the yellow text, and the hit point splats, I love it
Your all a bunch of newbs, I main elephant which is a perfectly balanced tank when it comes to strength, speed, health and intelligence. Elephant class should be a top tier. The only weakness to the elephant class is probably the human class but they are too overpowered to begin with in the first place.
The RS music memories of getting PJed.
could you do a video on the spider tier list? and i mean true spiders, not tarantulas.
I love the references to smash bros in between each shark tier or type.
Can you do an insect tier list?
I've heard a lot of rumors that I hope you can confirm or deny did the Chicken Class of the Egg Class come first?
What game is he talking about
Whale tier video would be nice. Killer whales and other toothed whales stack really high intelligence bonuses and often travel in numbers. Excellent early and late game potential.
Just gotta say, awesome idea. Love this. Don't stop.
8:12 woahh that’s a fucking scary sight (poor turtle)
lmaooo this is so original and funny
Lmao i love this guy
Insect tier list please
Bears please
Do humans next.
Thumbs up for chip skylark
Nerf the sharks buff crocodile
Can you discuss the bathypelagic metagame?
*SHINEY TEEF INDEAD*
*sheds a tear*\nR.i.p Fairyodd parents
love the overwatch references!
honeybadgers and apex predators
Awesome video!
melee reference!
Ayyy! You made it on trending. Congrats, dude!
Dog wold tier
haha, this is hilarious!! subbed
Liked for RuneScape references.
Do turtles next
Now THIS; This is quality content!
Humans: the lucio builds. You just kinda exist but are untouchable by most other builds, except for the symmetra build (mosquitos). and can sometimes clutch it by lasting a long time on the point with its massive amount of sustain
my suggestion would be bird builds
So one of your favorite builds for sharks is the Cookie Cutter Build? Pretty casual.
AWESOME!! Please make a discord server to discuss these things! \n\nLike if you agree, you can unlike after tier zoo noticed this as proof of the fact that this is no like bait
Cant tell if this is an actual game or he's making it like a game.
Like if you’re a seal player
thank you for finally trying to do something that games have not been able to do in a long time at least for me. If only there was a real game to help drive home the point and actually sparked the interest for everyone else good luck to you I hope it goes well man
What tier would the Goblin Shark fall into?
I don't like the retro theme of this channel. I feel like you'll get more subs if you update your intro and thumbnails
That background music is a variation of Runescape music
holy shit this channel is amazing
Could you make a video about the players in Australia? They seem brutal AF
You've made a video on the feline mains, now do one for canis mains
Runescape is dead. But i just heard old school is coming to mobile this Christmas👌
Hey! I'm from Wautoma, Wisconsin and we recently got shout out in one of the videos. Milty Wilty.
It's about 10:30 at night and I've smiled more from this video than I have all day, even when I pushed that Minotaur off a cliff in Destiny 2\nI really thought this would be some shitty countdown video, it's actually an informative and hilarious video. Keep up the good work!\n+1
could you make a top ten for S tier?
Do a bird orders tier list
Hi there,\nNow i've been a long time player of the Jaguar class, and this channel has been a great help for me when min maxing my stats and gear, so thank you!\n\nI was just wondering why you have not yet mentioned the Human Civilization expansion pack that was introduced 20,000 years ago? As a long time player of Earth, i'd like to know your thoughts on how that expansion changed the game and whether or not Human is a viable class.
Where’s that dog tier list?
This is something that, when I watched, I was surprised no one else had done it better
alligators or crocodiles would be cool
Random stuff\n \n \n \n _My shiny teeth and me_
OMG IS THAT INTRO SONG SHINY TEETH AND ME FROM FAIRLY ODD PARENTS!!!???
Please do a Tier list for Owls
Wait is this about a game?
What the fuck is this even?
The question for which guild invented Bite. LOL you're a genius.
I think that you should discuss the deadliest build in the current meta: bacteria. Although a slightly scummy class (because most other classes can’t really do anything to prevent being killed by bacteria), it is definitely the most prevalent class for those players who enjoy having extremely high K/D ratios without exactly playing the objective (that being gaining of knowledge and longevity). I think many would be surprised about the high stealth, mobility, and damage that the bacteria class boasts.
Do a spider build my guy
Dude, I love how you describe the animals in all you videos. Keep making it sound like a video game, I just subscribe today.
wow rood there are a lot of good things in wisconsin ok\nbut ++ on the tier list my dude B)
What the hell is this video? I don’t understand what’s going on
Bull sharks are stronger than Smashmouth pass it on
Emergency Room: Real Life Rescues is my favourite shark build
All of the videos in your recommended vids were smash bros things... 🤔\nAre you perhaps a Fox main?
If ymany of you guys use amino you shoukd join my TierZoo community! http://aminoapps.com/invite/SKG2B9PCHH
Personally, I thought Bull sharks should've been in S. The ability to swim in freshwater makes them a dominant force in both water types.
Could you do a reef ecosystem tier list??
can you analyze dogs? Ive noticed they are in S tier, but obviously the diversity of the species is incredible. I would love to see the spread between different types of dogs in the tier!
As of oct 2nd this video is 47 on trending\nSo HITMAN type video confirmed
Only good thing about living in Wisconsin! My cheese and I will fight you!
Do a video turtle tiers.
Im actually trying out the Homo sapien build and i wanted to sak your opinion on it.\nI kinda suck with it so some tips would be appreciated.
but what about the massive late game champ the Greenland Shark?
Can you do a pigeon or bat analysis, please? Great channel, btw.
So what is this
I know you did a video talking about if it's possible to play as a dinosaur, but could you try a video talking about actual dinosaurs and how they placed in the meta?
This was great video man! I just found your channel and have watched all your videos. Brilliant way of educating others.
Do a video on the urban biome, where several players (pigeons, racoons, rats and others) found ways to bypass the human defense mechanisms!\n\nOverall great channel, found it today and was sad to see there were only a couple of videos!
Depth...... It's A good game
I love how you do this as if it's a game 😂😂😂
I bet you get this request a lot, but pls do humans before the civilization expansion.
A human and primate tier list would be lit
What game is he talking about
You know I heard that sea shanty 2 asap
I would love a mmo simulation game that is an entire ecosystem
You should cover the viability of lizards on all servers
Will you do reviews of patched-out builds like the Dunkleosteus from 382 million years ago?
What’s this for?
As a dedicated sawshark main, we build for it because of one important philosophy, SOYO. SOYO stands for Swaggin On Your Opponent. I don't understand why tier lists don't understand this.
What game is his
Would you Consider the Human class, as overpowered as it is, to be a griefing class given Human Players' tendency to camp and subjugate lower tier classes and new players?
Fish Tiers! Hearing about the Marlin makes me wonder what other fish fit in what tier.
Can you talk about humans?
Greenland shark should be here..
runescape music in the background, wobbling reference, i'm cumming. I love this channel. Did you watch GT-X? Also congrats on the growth, Jesus. I remember thinking your count was way too low like a month ago, and, well, looks like it's made some progress
I saw this and was like SHAAAARRKKSSS YESSSS XD
So, where in the tier list do mosquitoes fit in?
I've always loved the hammerhead shark build; glad to see it getting recognized in the current meta.
Utub finnaly know what I like? This meta vid is just amazing! I know what to play in Sharkwatch!
Please do canine builds like the famous house dog or vicious wolves and hyenas
Yo cover and make a video about heavy support players like for example I like playing as elephant and playing with some of my friends who also play as elephant and we clear the server and get so much exp so fast! I'm already level 40+!!
why do people still play marine mammals with no defense? i.e. manatees, whales and all those guys? they're just floating exp.
Can we get a reptile class video
Birds of pretty tier list
I don't remember if you talked about the blue shark and if you did not what would they be
Do mosquitoes next, low tier but unbelievably good troll build
LEMON SHARK
Nerf sharks pls (?)
The r/videos mods jab made me wheeze.
But rays are sharks...
Human build analysis?
Sand sharks?
PERFECT
Big cat tier list
Loving this channel. :D
👍
Fox
another awesome entry, keep them coming.
Do human
Discuss artic animals
SNAKE TIER NEXT PLEASE
You should analyze horseshoe crabs
No goblin shark?
I'm confused
#44 on trending
Whales!
DO PRIMATES(maybe include bigfoot and yeti?)
DO BUGS
God tier shark the megalodon op.
Great memes.
the runescape music though
Wow my channel is mentionned? That's incredible! Totally unexpected! Thanks a ton it really means a lot :D I truly appreciate it!!!
Since you Apparently take Suggestions according to your About Sections, Maybe you should do one on Extinct Sharks (E.G Cardabiodon, Cretoxyrhina, Megalodon, Otodus, Hybodus Etc)
were are spiders on the tier list
Objective and critical analyses on the domesticated or trained pets.
Which low/bottom tier do you think has the best matchup against a top tier? Personally I think Shrikes have one of the best matchups against Bees. I'd say it's somewhere in the range of 70:30 Shirke's favor.
Could we have a tier list on the animals that live in the human made environments? I main the pigeon, it's nothing spectacular but it's good
I still think game sharks are f tier
I know saw shark is low tier but its fun to pvp against the occasional passerby swordfish build.
The parasite shark is a real bastard... His moves are cheap as hell.\n\n... Little sucker!
Ironic that the cookiecutter shark is such a unique build.
Got recommended this...im not mad about it
Yo, Bio major, graduated spring this year, UO, wondering take on invasives such as nutria, blackberries, and domesticated cats (wheres that video already?!?!)?
Where the heck is the goblin shark on the tier list?
Not to be that guy but some sharks can passively regain stamina without moving
You touched on the cookie cutter shark as a sort of parasite, but what do you think about parasites as a whole? As diverse as they are, there should be a lot to talk about
Cnidaria: build suggestions: Portuguese man of war, box jelly, and green hydra
what about the god tier megalodon
Someone please tell me what the fuck this is
I really want a Salamander discussion, specifically the Giant Chinese and Giant Japanese Salamanders.
hey, you should do a whale/dolphin/porpoise tier list! i wanna see that sky-high HP whale species, fam.
F tier sharks actually exist. Like the salmon shark and porbeagle.
Do you think it's fair that some animals get passive bonuses from aesthetics, which was designed to be purely cosmetic? For example tiger's stripes that also give a bonus to STL?
Can you do a video about an obscure prehistoric animal?
how about a vid on the pros and cons of a specialized scavenger build?
can we get some aerial dps analysis? interested in an owl build, but hard to ignore the sheer strength of the oh so popular falcon and eagle builds
Good good stuff!  Keep it up!
You should do a Vespid tier!
Would you consider making a video about what would happen if we banned humans? I've been trying to find a server without them for years.
Rodent tier list when? It would be very beneficial to those of us with rodent alts looking to succeed.
You should do a video about carnivorous plants
You should do a video on builds like the honey badger or wombat
What’s the name of this game
Yeah ever since release us cookie cutter sharks have been hard countered by most other bigger sharks.. like buff please
Who wants to see a freshwater fish tier list? I know they aren’t the meta right now, but certain builds can be very effective.
What would be the best build for dps flanker mains. I'm interested in trying out this platform any help is appreciated.
What tier is the Goblin Shark?
Its like you suck at cooking but with animals
what fucking game is this? is it just real life animals put into teers and shit?
thank you for finally trying to do something that games have not been able to do in a long time at least for me. If only there was a real game to help drive home the point and actually sparked the interest for everyone else good luck to you I hope it goes well man
You've yet to cover any air builds up to this point (birds)
>playing any marine class and not speccing into deep-sea survival\n>plebs don't know about the goblin shark
This is an amazing channel! But what about frilled sharks though. Either way love the content
Insect teir would be cool, also the blob fish
I know these are meant as jokes but they make sooo much sense. Except the crabs stuff
I'd like to see how insect players compare in the Meta. I understand that cicada players might be very low tier support, but what about the speedy tiger beetle. I swear if they put more focus into their size, they'd be faster than the speedy cheetah build.\n\n(Note: entomology gamer thats looking to help.)
r/videos mods - Sharpiness 0. They had it coming for a while.
Yo, a video on symbiotic relationships would be super interesting.
Jellyfish vid? Loving all of your content
What place do Fox and Falco have in this game?
i'd like to have your opinion on the high risk high reward playstyle of the salmons, especially when it comes to spawning minions.
What tier would the Goblin Shark fall into?
I don't like the retro theme of this channel. I feel like you'll get more subs if you update your intro and thumbnails
That background music is a variation of Runescape music
holy shit this channel is amazing
Could you make a video about the players in Australia? They seem brutal AF
You've made a video on the feline mains, now do one for canis mains
Runescape is dead. But i just heard old school is coming to mobile this Christmas👌
Hey! I'm from Wautoma, Wisconsin and we recently got shout out in one of the videos. Milty Wilty.
It's about 10:30 at night and I've smiled more from this video than I have all day, even when I pushed that Minotaur off a cliff in Destiny 2\nI really thought this would be some shitty countdown video, it's actually an informative and hilarious video. Keep up the good work!\n+1
could you make a top ten for S tier?
Do a bird orders tier list
Hi there,\nNow i've been a long time player of the Jaguar class, and this channel has been a great help for me when min maxing my stats and gear, so thank you!\n\nI was just wondering why you have not yet mentioned the Human Civilization expansion pack that was introduced 20,000 years ago? As a long time player of Earth, i'd like to know your thoughts on how that expansion changed the game and whether or not Human is a viable class.
Where’s that dog tier list?
This is something that, when I watched, I was surprised no one else had done it better
alligators or crocodiles would be cool
Random stuff\n \n \n \n _My shiny teeth and me_
OMG IS THAT INTRO SONG SHINY TEETH AND ME FROM FAIRLY ODD PARENTS!!!???
Please do a Tier list for Owls
Wait is this about a game?
What the fuck is this even?
The question for which guild invented Bite. LOL you're a genius.
I think that you should discuss the deadliest build in the current meta: bacteria. Although a slightly scummy class (because most other classes can’t really do anything to prevent being killed by bacteria), it is definitely the most prevalent class for those players who enjoy having extremely high K/D ratios without exactly playing the objective (that being gaining of knowledge and longevity). I think many would be surprised about the high stealth, mobility, and damage that the bacteria class boasts.
Can you do one on ants? Or just insects in general cuz I reckon ants should be high tier A at least, probably S?
Thank god for the recommended tab. This idea for videos is so fucking genius.
Forgot humans another deadly rival
Pangolin, anteater type builds
4:25 HOLD UP NOW
Love the vids dude
Do insects next, or wolverines.
Apes. Canines. Dragons.

*goes on trending*\n\n*sees shark*\n\n*instant click*\n\n*actually really enjoys video*\n\n*subscribe*
What game is he talking about
I would love to see a video discussing the players that have unlocked food storage on the intelligence progression and how that has turned out for them. This strategy has produced some really cool results I think.\n\nOther ideas I have are a tier video for players who have maxed out various branches of the flight tree, or terrestrial characters that took the endurance branch of the mobility tree as far as they could.\n\nThese videos are a great concept and well made. Hopefully they are as fun to produce as to watch. Keep up the good work.
please I need to know the tier list for birds of prey
Nice video man! Keep it up. Make a Monkey Tier video please. :)
How about a video on the Yellowstone meta and how it's changed
Can we talk about the deep water server shark the goblin shark? I mean clearly it has the strongest aoe fear. And it is passive. I mean have you ever seen a goblin shark. That thing looks terrifying.
Since marlin are talked about so much in this video, could you make a video based soley on the marlin build?
Talk about how Pugs are an S teir Dog class
I've heard rumours of an unknown (?) Tier, what are your thoughts on this?
The short fin mako is top tier. Bottom line. So much disrespect. Smh
Are there any top tiers that break the conventions of the general meta - game? Generally high intelligence and pack behaviors are thought to be hallmarks of a high tier player, right?
So I main the cane toad and I don't know what the matchup is against sea creatures. Could you do a matchup video for characters
Where are jellies in the meta? Are they even playable?
Would like to see a video about bees, wasps, and hornets. I can't be the only one who's sick and tired of being griefed by these players
I think you should move the Great White down to an A rank. The reason being, Great Whites have this huge disadvantage of being sensitive to climates. They seem to be one of the only characters that will take damage in captivity even after being released, so bad in fact that no player has ever been able to survive long after something like that. Also they have a really competitive early game stage, where new players have to battle inside the mother to see which one will get to continue playing, which greatly drops the amount of players.
Gotta say, you missed one of the best builds the Greenland Shark. It has the highest HP clocking in at at least 300 years, maybe more, they have an anti freezing buff which makes them immune to become frozen, and have one of the best smell stats of all the Sharks.
YO I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THAT WHIP SHARK BUILD EXISTED\n\nBRB ABOUT TO REINVEST SOME SAVED EVOLUTION POINTS
Do a video about the Killer whales .. they are solo OP
Hey! I really enjoyed this video, being someone who has an alt in the Ocean Servers (Shark Guild, Thresher Shark build specifically)\nI was curious about a couple insect builds in particular, though, so I figured this would be the best place to ask (not a huge fan of insects, so I avoid most of their boards). What's the deal with Bees? Why would they spec into an attack that fatally damages themselves?
Tier zoo please make an intelligence class rating for us Intelligent builds
subreddit mod tier list, F:  /r/videos D: /r/smoobypost C: /r/me_irl B: /r/highqualitygifs A: /r/casualconversation S: /r/natureisfuckinglit

Please cover birds of prey. They seem to be hard to kill with no AA guns added yet. Also cover turtles and if u can maybe those ancient croc-like salamanders
I really love your videos
I'm a honey badger main and very content how high do you rate them?

Can we get a legendary character analysis?
Hey, how is meta tier different from conservation status, aren't species that survived to this point meta by default?
I am so lost bc I just found this in my recommendations
Hey when will we get the frog tier list video?
I'm loving all the melee and overwatch references, as well as runescape text. Keep up the good work my man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThou I wouldn't mind some tf2 references.
I'm thinking depth... Didn't know the whip was a real thing for thresher XD
About which game are you talking ?
Someone I know was recommended to watch this video. Hence, I am watching this shit and cant believe you already have 175k subs.
Are we going to get a domestic housecat video?
As a long time rat player, I would like to see the best rodent builds.

It's a prequel guys they had Dutch in the trailer
Van der Linde was a side character that wasn't as important as Bill Williamson or Javier Escuela.\n\nAlllllrighhhht, then...
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info
When is bully 2 coming i am excited about that ☺
magnificent 7 was a great movie
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?
For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3.
Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
I seen this trailer
Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.
yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
I swear this game better then the GTA series
Is it for PC though.?
This is what happens when you put two idiots in charge..
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
It's just a cut scene of cowboys eating at camp, this is how games get hyped beyond all reason, rockstar games or not.
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
It's comes out in auttum
there was a morality system in red dead redemption
Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer
Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
lol Marty was all over the place in this video
I can finally hang myself in peace.
I really hope it’s not all online
That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
How did they not recognize Dutch
I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game.
Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
yo I cant wait for it
No game no hype, those are the rules.
Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April.
hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters...
He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you...
“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol
Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
I only care about multiplayer!
can preorder now. o yeah were close
throwing my money at the screen, want to pre-order, but can't find it on STEAM????????????
are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
it could be as late as june.
I'm betting and hope one of the  main characters is a the native american with the rag sack.
THE HYPE TRAIN is gone!!!! this is a must!!!
Marty's hands keep shaking, is that hype?
I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking.
How will they work shark cards into this...
Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much
Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
DID YOU HAVE TO PUT A TIMER IN THE BEGINNING
The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day
Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
Best open world game ever Coming right up
RDR2 will look and play best on Xbox One X!\nStay tuned, pc to run this @ 0p & 0fps.
Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of..
any players who havent played rdr but likes cowboys?
Coming 2019
I'm playing this on Xbox one X can't wait
I want gta 6
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2

Amateurs....
great hype much erection
DUTCH VAN DER LINDE jeez

Wow 1 hour stream for 1 min trailer ggwp idiots
This is how uncreative IGN is
Fully torqued
PC?
omg can`t wait
The baddest mofo in red dead is still Juan Sierra: Quien quiere peleyar con migo!
K
Hyped
What's interesting from both trailer's is the wild life. They seem to have their own eco system where they'll hunt, feed, dehydrate etc. In Red Dead 1 the animals will just stand there and any predators will hunt you and nothing else. But in Red Dead 2 trailer The predators look as though they'll will hunt & kill other prey as well as your self. What's more interesting is the way this new eco system will impact on your horses. Do they get hungry, thirsty or even die of natural causes? Cos' maintaining your horse is a whole new gameplay mechanic not encountered before and will be very interesting to see in game.
Was that captured on a high-end PC? I'd love if it did, but I doubt it'll look like that on my PS4.
You guys are literally oblivious lol that was a younger Dutch in the trailer so this is going to be a prequel and you can bet that john is going to make an appearance
I can't wait for the multiplayer coop that we just couldn't get right in GTA\n*SOMEBODY WANTS TO JOIN YOUR POSSE*
That man with the magnificent mustache is Dutch motherfuckin Van Der Linde.
Will this have shark cards??! I WANNA BUY A COTTON FARM
I AM\nHYPED FOR THIS 👀🤓
How stupid are these guys! That politician is Dutch, the leader of the gang!!! ARGHHH And its definitely a prequel!
If you're the supposed experts that are going to analyze the trailer how about at least reading the synopsis of the first one on the wiki? 😑
We don't know if it's a prequel Young Dutch was in the trailer you dopes...
How did these guys not hear him say Always Dutch.
It's a prequel guys they had Dutch in the trailer
Van der Linde was a side character that wasn't as important as Bill Williamson or Javier Escuela.\n\nAlllllrighhhht, then...
My god, this rampant speculation is why people always get over-hyped and are ultimately disappointed in games. Temper your expectations, people. I get it, you're excited, but let's be a little realistic here.
Seriously? We knew it was a prequel when they showed us the first trailer.
Wow. You really know nothing. Of course it is a prequel and from the trailer it is crystal clear that it is. Do you prepare for such a show at all?
Just look to the right the trailer has already been released
Watching this while in a lecture session lol
Will the be available on the Sega Genesis?
Wow only fuckin 6 months because of delay...... smh rockstar
hey ign your description says its a sequel LMAO ITS PREQUEL
what an abysmal analysis. took them like ten minutes to realize who dutch is and that its a prequel. and they only found out because chat told them... pretty pathetic
I feel like the kid in the trailer is john and this character, Morgan, will at several points cross paths with John. I think this new character is gonna betray Dutch at some point and maybe Marston will be the guy that kills him.
Only real ones watch the entire 24 min loading screen
Rockstar isn't EA or Ubisoft.\n\nHype
Off topic but does anybody know any good STD clinics around?
Tom Sellick character   ? thats Dutch and he was the main villain ...did you guys even play the game?
They are so good at covering games that they do'nt remember Dutch, and that he is old in RDR, and here we see Dutch way younger, so props to IGN for being so good at seeing everything but the obvious...
“Morgan” calls the man at the end “Dutch” I’m presuming Dutch Vanderlin.....
YOU GOT SOME MONEY FOR ME BOY
stil not on pc
hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
Dutch Van der Linde was anything but a minor character. He was the leader of Dutch's gang and John Marston's boss before the original Red Dead Redemption.
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
Can we have Indians in this one
You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought
Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info

Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
Dutch looks like he’s about to be a damn good antagonist...
I was hoping for\nSpring 2018 but to tide you over Red Dead Redemtion remaster this holiday for Ps4, Xbox One, Switch and PC!
If I cant climb up or paraglide off that cliff, i wont buy!
AT LAST\nIVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
But they already released the new trailer....?
I want a GTA5 style online game where you can ride with your posse and do co op bank heist's and train robberies. Cant wait for this game, wish it was out before Christmas.
Is it just me or does the badass stab lady look like bonnie mcfarlane from rdr?
I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking.
How will they work shark cards into this...
Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much
Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
Is it for PC though.?
it's not north or south dakota, or montana, or literally anywhere you listed because none of those places are the WEST.
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?
For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3.
Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
I seen this trailer
Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.
yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
I swear this game better then the GTA series
yo I cant wait for it
Marty's hands keep shaking, is that hype?
DID YOU HAVE TO PUT A TIMER IN THE BEGINNING
The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day
Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
Best open world game ever Coming right up
Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of..
When you skip the guys talking and just watch the trailer. Can't wait for this game!
Please god no character switching
I think the woman is Annie Stokes from Red Dead Revolver!
Watching theses two grasp at straws try to gleam anything from a one minute trailer is ridiculous
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2
It has to be a prequel because dutch is in the end !!!!!!
WTF? there wasn't sound!
PC please
any players who havent played rdr but likes cowboys?

What's interesting from both trailer's is the wild life. They seem to have their own eco system where they'll hunt, feed, dehydrate etc. In Red Dead 1 the animals will just stand there and any predators will hunt you and nothing else. But in Red Dead 2 trailer The predators look as though they'll will hunt & kill other prey as well as your self. What's more interesting is the way this new eco system will impact on your horses. Do they get hungry, thirsty or even die of natural causes? Cos' maintaining your horse is a whole new gameplay mechanic not encountered before and will be very interesting to see in game.
Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!

It's comes out in auttum
there was a morality system in red dead redemption
Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer
Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
lol Marty was all over the place in this video
I can finally hang myself in peace.
I really hope it’s not all online
That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
How did they not recognize Dutch
I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game.
Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about.
No game no hype, those are the rules.
Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April.
hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters...
He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you...
“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol
Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
I only care about multiplayer!
can preorder now. o yeah were close
throwing my money at the screen, want to pre-order, but can't find it on STEAM????????????
are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
it could be as late as june.
I'm betting and hope one of the  main characters is a the native american with the rag sack.
hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
Is it for PC though.?

I'm conflicted. On one hand I wanna see an arcanine episode, since he's my favorite, but I don't wanna have him ruined for me...
A random thought... If Ditto has a set mass(mass can't be created), his weight shouldn't be able to change when he takes the form of a larger Pokemon, then a plain Ditto should have the same weight and mass as a Ditto that takes the form of a Snorelax. \n\nNow Here's a question! How large of a pokemon or object would Ditto have to transform into, until his density, is less than the air around him, and he begins to float? \n\nPlease upvote, I'm curious about this one...
Pretty sure every Poke-tuber on Youtube has done at least one video covering this exact subject matter.
15 mins on black holes and y a Pokémon can't make one.
How about the Pokédex entry for Magcargo? It claims that it is 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit which would make it literally impossible for normal humans to even get near the thing without immediately frying to death. Also, the entries aren't written by the professors. They, instead, have children go out and collect their data for them which seems extremely unprofessional and thus, could lead to tons of misinformation within the dex. Misinformation that, as far as we know, the professors never bother to check and fix.
Legit \nHello everybody want to get free stuff download Verydice and start rolling use my code 1177158
Hey matpat, MATPAT! STAT! So we have the pokedex, right? And we, a ten year old kid are filling it out, NOT the professors so basically we're writing the entry's therefore making things up because, say we see a gardevoir use shadow ball and immediately think it's a black hole?
Magearna plase...realy: How da heal does that thing moves?!?!?
Honestly would love to see Eevees or hell maybe one of the alolan pokemon?
What if pokemon is magic and they is no science to it.\nWhat if pokemon have inner power that can create and control energy.
My one point of contention with your reasoning on this MatPat is that you assume the black hole has to be stable. More than likely the black holes it would use as attacks are meant to strike quickly, (most likely within a fraction of a second, since while they're turn based in game, Pokemon battles are generally shown to be relatively fast paced in the show), before dissipating. This would allow it to attack and deal severe damage to its opponent, without going to the incredibly ridiculous lengths necessary to create a stable black hole. Not saying your information about black holes or your research is incorrect, but rather that you're not considering the practical application of how it would attack with said black holes. Still a good episode over all, and I'm looking forward to more as there are a lot of entries that make little sense, but I did have to point out my personal disagreement with your over all conclusion on this one......
HAHAHAHA I just noticed you are using the Kerbal Space Program soundtrack! Nice choice for a space episode!
Wouldnt its hug kill you via the massive red spike on its chest
Matpat: the Pokedex is full of lies\nme: click\nMatpat: just 1 example
Black holes are product of scientists imagination.
5:30  “Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.”
Your setting yourself up for failure in another video. Then you won't have the pokedex to lean on for backup evidence
Soundtrack sponsored by kerbal space program. Is there a game theory on that coming?
Moltres like how does the fire stay alight when moltres is flying super fast
heres the first thing. Pokemon is fictional, it doesnt always need to follow every real life law of physics
Or maybe gardeviour creates something that can suck in stuff, but isn't a black hole, and they just call it a black hole.
Be nice to my creepy Wisp Monster, MatPat! She's sensitive...\n\nAnyways, what about Swampert? Towing yachts at jet ski speeds seems a bit far fetched for the guy, right?
came for the pokemon, stayed for the science.
Matty Patty you're forgetting one very important thing. The pokedex isn't written by the professors, but by the 10 year olds they give them to. That's why if your character only sees a Pokemon but doesn't catch it only the picture and some very limited (basically nothing) information is added. Its only when the trainer catches the Pokemon that the entry is filled out. Its not lies, but the limited knowledge (see myths and lore) and over active imagination of a 10 year old trainer. I'm disappointed in you Pattycakes, you're better than this.
Who came first: Arceus or Mew?
But i cant read D:\n\nIf you are wonderong, lies means read that in german.\n\nOh and btw, no one is mentioning that Mat is doing   scientific theorys again?
I think the keywords are psychic power. Maybe it's psychic power are dense enough to create a black hole. Don't forget it's a while different universe so not everything is the same as it is in ours.
Wait the dex is filled by the trainers so perhaps that pokemon is just using shadow ball or dark big bang attack and the trainer being just a kid doesn't know any better.
Trust me, grab nearly ANY ghost type Pokemon and you have one creeypasta filled episode. Like Yamask (It's mask is it's former human face.) or even Phantump (The soul of a child that died in the woods and then possessed a tree.).
10:21 if black holes absorb light how are you reading this
Can you do a theory on doraemon especially of bamboo copter and anywhere door
4:00 there is no such thing as black light bouncing into your eye. Black is the absence of color, where a material partially absorbs light. It just so happens that black holes absorb all light. If black holes were invisible, we'd be able to see straight through them.
The catch is that It was admitted that black holes don't actually exist, given that any amount of matter smashed into such a small space would begin to rotate, and the smaller it got, the faster it would rotate, until the kinetic force of the spin was pushing just as hard as the gravity was pulling, causing it to simply rotate infinitely. Therefore, black holes don't actually exist. At best they make certain mathematical problems possible, but that's about it.
uhhh question: what if gardevoir could compress the mass of something small (similar mass to a bullet) inside the danger whatever it may be?\nsure it would quickly evaporate but in the fraction of a second that it would exist it could burn the danger away (altough I know nothing about black holes so maybe I'm wrong)\nor I don't know... gardevoir could compress THE DANGER ITSELF! once again it would evaporate, but that would work in the trainner's favor would it not?
The moon could NOT become a stable Black Hole.\nTo become a Black Hole and stay stable you need 2 things:\nMass (around 150x our sun)\nAnd a supernova that crushes that mass into a space as tiny as a tennisball. \nYou cant create a black Hole that can stay alive out of sth as small as the moon or 20x our sun my friend :P
Can you do a book theory of the Jedi order book series the yusa vong Wars please it’s a Star Wars book please
So gardevor is the most usless pokemon but could also be the most devistating to the earth...........................i might go live on the sun now ( this is the year 8099)
What if it makes a black home out of the other Pokemon? It would immediately disintegrate and stop the threat. OR it could use a black hole made from air, causing an effect kind of similar to cavitation (that thing that makes mantis shrimps so powerful) not to mention suffocation or collapsed lungs.
Just saying, but the Pokedex says that Gardevoir will give its own life for its trainer. Meaning that Gardevoir still does its job(sort of, at the expense of everything on planet Earth).
Good. Thank you. Now I have a more recent account where you admit you are human and that you make mistakes for that plethora of idiots who keep pretending that theory is a shield to pretend you are always right.
The liar here is you! The Pokedex isn't written by the Professors, it's empty when you get it. They task YOU with filling it in! Oak says he is too old to go and do the research himself, so you have to find all the Pokémon and report back
7:57 Our house... In the middle of our house-
hey thanks for making a pokemon video is my birthday and i em pokemon crazy so thank you hoop to see and here moor from you love you
I dont see any problem with the smaller black holes that fizzle out? That says nothing against the dex entry.
Pokemon Sun and Moon? You could continue the multiple universe theory!
Woah, that Aladin reference is actually a perfect way to quickly sum up black holes, props for that Matt! How did you even make the connection?
Smh I hate when American debunk anime logic. You just don’t.
Applying real world physics to psychic energy which doesn't exist in the real world....ok
The music you put in your videos scare me
50hrs of gameplay per game? haha, no
I am a simple man.\nI see a reference to Hitchhiker guide to the galaxy, I upvote
Don't you think that the ONE AND ONLY EXAMPLE you put forward speaks more towards its psychic strength rather than the black holes it self? After all being able to compress matter with only the power of your mind, much like your jokes and over all humor, is no laughing matter.
Should of looked at Macargo the lava snail or regice the really really cold.
The definition said nothing about needing matter, just a gravimetric force.
It could always crush the threat into a tiny black hole
Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell: What if there was a black hole in your pocket?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ\n\nA micro black hole with the mass of a coin, would evaporate in an explosion comparable to a nuclear bomb.
If you're going to say that the first law of thermodynamics applies to Pokémon, you're gonna have a bad time. The Pokémon universe is clearly one that fundamental physics doesn't apply in.
I really hate your voice........
How is this title not clickbait?
I don't see the lie here?\nthere is obviously a middle ground it's not either the moon or a micro pebble\nfirst you need to Quantify the weight of that Pokemons average Psychic power as that is the units that are being expended here\nin order to do that Mattpat needs to go all death battle with the pokemon in question and i'm uncertain that the information is readily available in universe
MATPAT ALL OF YOUR POKEMON THEORIES SUCK GIANT GREAT BALLS!! PLEASE STOP MAKING POKEMOM BASED VIDEOS
I like your death note reference
i was hoping for it to be more about the pokedex and more pokemon, not 1 pokemon :(
1:23 ...the Pokedex, this pocket encyclopedia... I'm gonna' have to stop you there, MatPat. It's not an encyclopedia at all! If it were, it would be called the Pokepedia! Instead, it's a PokeDEX. Why? Because it's a Pokemon index! Indexes are informal collections of information designed to give a general knowledge of a given subject. Thing is? An index isn't held up to anywhere near as high a standard as an encyclopedia. If the author of the index chooses to do proper research and find the real truth about things, all the better, but it is nowhere near required. Which is why some 'dex entries for Exeggcute claim it to be a cluster of eggs, while others say it is merely MISTAKEN for eggs frequently, when the truth is they're more like seeds. Mistakes like the former are acceptable in an index.
Wait... if black holes produce radiation,  if radiation has mass... wouldn't it be pulled back into the black hole
The concept of black hole radiation contradicts the concept of black holes themselves. Enough gravity that light cannot escape. No mass can escape that gravitational pull, therefore radiation from a black hole is absolutely impossible. It's a logical impossibility for both of those concepts to be true.
something my friend explained to me, all of the entries in the poke'dex could just be nothing more than folklore, not an actuality. in the universe of pokemon, the pokemon themselves have been around a lot longer than the dex and considering these creatures are magical, there's a good chance the characters would have stories and legends about the them. sure the professors were the ones to have made the dex, however they themselves never once say they saw these creatures doing some of these really creepy things, and if they did, they're monsters especially in the case of Driftloon
Do giratina (it would probably be interesting) 😉😉
Victini's infinite energy that its Pokédex entries reference cannot actually be infinite. How can you actually fit an infinite energy source into a body with finite volume, let alone one about the size (and indeed, mass) of a Pikachu? Even taking into account the famous Einstein equation E = m*c^2, you would get a whole bunch of potential energy, so certainly enough to make the Tepig's attack overkill even against a Pokémon against which it has a type disadvantage (which I at least think is Samurott), but it's still a finite figure.
Ya know MatPat you say black holes are really dense. You're right. I did this as a science project at school. Black holes are INFINITELY dense!
Can you please analyse Deoxys? In the Pokedex is written something about a Virus.
I love all the references in this video, especially gmm and the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy reference
Matpat, you need to up your Hawking game :). Ultra small black holes are extremely deadly as they convert their entire mass into energy crazy fast.  A 5gram black hole would create a bigger blast than a nuke... many nukes in fact.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8nHBGFKLHZQ\n\nYou can also create black holes without needing great amounts of mass, check out a kugleblitz, basically a black hole created with extreme amounts of light.
You do a debunk on Blastoise and the Cannons on it's back

... what if the big issue is the Pokedex isn't written by the Professors, but by the 10 year old trainers that they are given too... that is part of your job in the first pokemon game, fill the Pokedex...
Black holes ARE NOT invisible. For something to be invisible light must freely pass through it. You would see a blackhole. When you walk into a pitch black room you don't call everything in the dark room invisible.... you call it dark.... like you can't see anything because your eyes are unable to spot light.... Seeing a blackhole would be the same. Not to mention the light bending around the blackhole would be insanely bright. Quasars and blazars are some of the brightest things in our universe.
Guys every video thumbnail on this channel with the game theory logo has matpat in it!
I think that even if those mini black holes that Gardevoir creates, evaporates quickly, they last long enough to protect their trainers from certain projectiles
Let me stop you there at 1:57 you're already wrong it's not a main source of information in the games manga and anime pokedex's are rare and only handed to certain people only the protagonist has one in each. Youngster Joey doesn't have a pokedex. None of the champions even refer to a pokedex except Cynthia
Whether you believe in the validity of IQ ratings or not, I've always questioned the servitude of an Alakazam and it's intelligence quotient of over 5000 (which has nothing on black holes or ability to distort time and space OR....)
You didn't say that Gardevoir's spike thing will impale u if u hug it
this is the pokemon world, where physics is different than what we know.
1) How comes he didn't mention the rule 34?\n\n2) Darumaka. Do Darumaka next.
Renucleus. Just analyse if it is possible to exist.
The real question is how is trubbish alive it literally is a bag of rubbish
Why is this stupid idiot talking about black holes for a Pokemon video so stupid talk about running out of content
What if gardavoir extually uses its psychic abilitys to hold it stable and in place
Quick note: The professors don't do their own research. The children they gives pokedexes to so the research.
Gen 3 for Pokémon go confirmed
This is just one of the many pokedex entries you could say the same thing about XD
The eeveelutions if that's haw u spell it 😃
Came to hear about the multiple lies in the Dex.\n\n\n\nGot a fifteen minute lesson about black holes and one pokemon lol.
How do z-moves and/or mega evolution work
Where is my doctor who part 3 matpat
let's be honest we all know why he covered gardevoir
I would love to see you make a Theory about Warframe's lore.
He does know that the pokemon can use psychic ability doesn't he ?
I already knew this as fact. Time for the extra dark detail about it!\n\n\n\n\nBut accually tho luv ur content
Im sorry but this is not a hate comment but this isnt eveb about the pokedex its about blackholes....
I read the black hole because I used the pause button😐 derp 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
also Gardevoir can freaking eat your dreams, so I bet it could use that power to at least pull up 2 chunks of the earth, squish them together, and create a black hole lasting at least a couple seconds, using it to protect it's trainer!
rhyhorn, how its bones are 1000x harder than human bones
Sorry MatPat. Austin already does The Science!
There are pokemon like yamask who apparently where at one point humans according to the pokedex but this has some holes like how are there human ghosts if they become pokemon when they die?and how do they even know that these pokemon were humans?
But matpat, that's just one pokemon,  not all pokemon can have wrong information on them, right?
Before watching this theory, here is my theory that I really believed for a long time. In the Pokemon games, the pokedex entry that you gain after catching a new pokemon is so inaccurate, it could only be written by a certain 10 year old. I believe that the entries are written by the player on the spot without any prior research. This explains the stupid descriptions like Charmander's tail and the terrible measurements. Wailord's weight per volume puts him as being as dense as hot air balloon.
How does a squirtle- Blastoise hold so much water in them? Can someone explain?
Here is voice acting for the intro!!   Destroyed all of your child hood fnaf was made up of dead children,solved everything in gaming,and was mostly right!!!!da da da!!!😆
You just debunked your Antman can destroy the world theory.
In theory , f=m(g)/r^2. So so even if you squeeze 2 atoms together to a point where it is small enough that it can collapse on its own gravity , Ta-da , mini backhole. \n Also note that hawking radiation is caused by vacuum fluctuations.  \nNote 2, note that is failed to maintain its gravity to stay together , release energy \nE=mc^2 lama
But you ignored the whole it uses psychic energy to create the black hole it, out right stated the creation technique which can be interpreted to mean that it uses its psychic energy to condense the mass but it could also mean that it creates one out of pure psychic energy which would be a completely different entity then a black hole but may be explained best by using a black hole as an example. Also I think it should be acknowledged that true psychic abilities are not necessarily covered by science so its hard to say what rules of the physical world it obeys and follows gardevoir may create a true black hole of mass but through psychic energy be able to ignore its gravity and manipulate how the force acts on its environment like how we are able to direct a vacuum cleaner it may be a tool she can use.\n\nJust curious about your thoughts on this? Still love the show though.
Hello Matt, I know you often read the comments on your videos, and I really hope you read this one too. This is my first comment ever, and the reason I chose to make this my first comment is because of the videos you made on fake news. They changed my perception on the world and helped me realize that things aren't always as they seem. I'm new to your channels, but since I discovered them I've pretty much marathoned 'em. What I'm trying to say is that you're content is great, and I hope you continue to open peoples eyes. Good luck and God speed.
4:22 Me: You missed an opportunity to make an Interstellar reference 10 seconds later Yyeeeeessss
If black holes absorb light, how are you reading this? - lol nice one (10:22)
But what if Gardevoir makes the opponent into a black hole?
I know that this one video is just covering what the description but... gardevoir (in the anime since a player can choose different moves) normally has shadow ball. so its probably referring to that in a tall tale.
arceus coming out of an egg and then being king of pokemon
Yes but assuming Gardevoir's telekinetic powers are formidable enough, wouldn't it be possible for it to create a black hole within its opponent? My logic is that even though this black hole would last at most 10^-27 seconds, it could still do lots of damage within a body instead of a vacuum like in the particle accelerator.
The pokedex is still in Beta, \nevery game the professor mentions that you and a few more trainers are trialing it. \nThat's why it's your job is to complete the pokedex.
Did mat pat straight up call the 10 commandments bull
wait what ? Black holes produce heat ? ludicrous, where do you get your info really ?
hey matpat can you make another video on fnaf or bendy and the ink machine ?
Please do the Jesus Pokemon, pleaseeeeee or dialga, idk one of the Legendary Pokemons and I'll be Satisfied 150% still i'll  be pleased mat （＾ω＾）
Gotta give points on that Hitchhikers reference game theory.
There should be a theory of krabby actually being a mantis shrimp and not a crab since mantis shrimps create cavitation bubbles which have a strong similarity to in the cartoon where krabby signature attack is bubble beam
You're making a big deal out of this.
I think a better much more accepted theory about the pokedex's inaccuracy is that it's written by 10 year olds. The plot of the games is you collect data on pokemon via your pokedex which then fills itself out. If you look at some of the entries they obviously seem written by a child. Check Alakazam for a good example.
Something on how arceus is the god of Pokemon despite mew being the first Pokemon would be awesome.
it could just make the black hole out of the danger so yah
Soooo.... what I'm gathering is that Thor's hammer is heavier... than a microscopic black hole with the mass of a moon? Tbh I have no honest why I thought of that. I'm stupid. If you had my twelve year old mind, you're understand.
Imagine if Wikipedia was full of lies.\n\n\n\n\n\nLol
You should do how deadly would it be to fall off rainbow road
Please do the fake pikachu one that would be great!
torterra ! hey mat pat how does it have a tree at its back. like so as he could see
Dear matpat, Just a quick question, with fnaf4 is it possible the stuffed toys we see disappear at the end of the game are in the box at the end of the game we cant open, if you think about it, it kinda makes sense but i dont know if this has already been covered already, please like this so Matpat can see because i really want to see this covered
Here's a Pokemon MatPat could do: Magcargo. Mainly because of it's Pokemon Sapphire entry: Magcargo's body temperature is approximately 18,000 degrees F. Water is vaporized on contact. If this Pokémon is caught in the rain, the raindrops instantly turn into steam, cloaking the area in a thick fog.
Bulbasaur, please, I want to make sure my favorite Pokemon is perfect. Please.
Your eyes perceive little to no light as black, so by not seeing anything  you are seeing black. It's like saying that you are seeing nothing, so it's not nothing, it is invisible.
Maybe her psychic powers can make that the black hole not emit radiation

Matpat analyse mimikyu
Maybe they meant to say that it can manipulate gravity around it rather than creating a black hole. It would make more sense that way since there are pokemon and moves that deal with manipulating gravitational pull on themselves and their opponents
Gardevoir could just compress the object/creature imposing danger on its trainer into a blackhole, which would be too small and immediately fizzle into the air as hawking radiation.
Yeah okay, the black hole thing is incredibly silly, but the amount of Rule 34 on that thing is absurd!!\n(Semi-)Joking aside, I'll never understand pokemon titles. Like Gardevoir being the Embrace pokemon when [a] no dex entry ever really explains that, and [b] it has that spiky-heart-crystal-doodad on its chest. I always assumed it would have to be soft, like fleshy, otherwise... well the internet is full of embrace jokes.\nAnother one that leaps to mind is Arcanine being the Legendary pokemon. What makes big-ol' hellhound legendary?
I got that hitchhikers guide to the galaxy reference with the wale and flower
But what if a cubic metre of air (mass ~1.3kg) was condensed into a black hole in the centre of an attack. It would have a lifetime of 1.8*10^-16 seconds, but could surely disrupt the attack velocity, energy, etc. If not, the movement of air would also affect the attack, disrupting it in some way. If it compressed 10 cubic metres of air, the black hole would have a lifetime of 1.8*1^-13 s and even more mass to disrupt the attack. This also isn't considering the heat that would be generated by compressing so much mass so quickly. My point in this argument is that the black hole does not need to be stable to affect the environment and if the description was accurate it would be beneficial not to have a stable black hole as that would destroy the earth as stated. Also there is plenty of mass lying around that could be used, and wouldn't be noticed missing. Although it takes tremendous energy to compress matter past its neutron degeneracy pressure, is there an accurate or reliable scale or description of what psychic powers are? Idk, I thought of this argument and found a calculator online.
The fun of this was soaked by a black hole
But what if Gardevoir used its powers to condense the threat/enemy into a black hole? That would turn out okay, because the black hole would be unstable and simply evaporate, rather than destroying the world.
Please can you do Pikachu?
Two actual Pokedex facts:\nMagcargo. It's literally hotter than the sun.\nAlso one day a kid woke up as a Kadabra. Sounds legit.
And yes they do evaporate extremely quickly but what if you make to many of them ir may be by minute amounts it still takes bacteria and matter of all sorts... all the numbers will add up to a big number.... please think about what your talking about scientists. Dont destroy your own planet.
Have you heard of whats called different universes?
I can't stand these black hole analogies. They're so bad \nI hope he ends up mentioning micro black holes that you can create from two particles mashing into each other which then evaporate to hawking radiation. \nI dunno how a pokemon would want to deal a neither world destroying attack nor an attack that is too small to even notice. There is no black hole size where this would be the case. \nSo yeah Matt you did it. You called BS on pokemon physics. Good job
well he just ruined my favorite pokemon, thanks matpat XD. seriously tho keep up the good work :)
Mat, the FNAF timeline is messed up, cuz the phone guy in the second says there's no doors this time even though the time era is BEFORE FNAF 1. To be honest the whole damn TIMELINE is messed up. Please theory this, or tell me at me Twitter @DukeTheNuke2.
I think wailord would do for a good exposing
11:07 MAT BILL NYE ISN'T A REAL SCIENTIST OMG!!!
Do Rayquaza and how it gets the energy to mega evolve despite not having a trainer and also, how it somehow consumes meteors for energy?
13:19 fun fact as black holes gain mass their density drops
So what if instead of using mass, psychic abilities alone are used to distort the fabric of space (which is from my understanding, those distortions cause gravity) and this distortion causes the same effects as a black hole without the need of any mass? Really would appreachiate feedback here though!
Matpat please do a theory about gravity falls series, it has a lot of mystery to unlock for you <3
A microscopic black hole is what is needed to leap in time in the time drama anime steins gate,maybe the microscopic black hole is used to reverse time although that kills gardevoir in the process since she has to maintain a the black hole for long enough .
Maybe MatPat should do a theory about mega evolution or z-moves or maybe even both like which is superior!
But here is the thing... it's a game.. their black holes don't follow the laws of physics.. \n\nThat said... yah, a lot of stuff in the Dex are just legends and myths added in... and it's more for us players than for the characters.
Didn't Austin already cover this?
When he was talking about black holes, anyone jump to make sure they still had our gravity? 😂
What you forget is that when a black hole completely evaporates it releases a tremendous amount of energy. If a black hole with the mass of a penny were to completely evaporate, it would cause an explosion larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. So, if gardevoir were to create mini black holes she could attack opponents with controlled explosions.
Gardevoir has telekinetic powers. Expending all of its energy, it uses this power to SUSTAIN a black hole. Telekinesis is one of those abilities that is more powerful the better the user understands what they're doing. The Gardevoir knows what it's doing. It's pulling matter from all around it into the black hole, thus sustaining it artificially in a way that natural black holes simply cannot do themselves.\nYour science is right, but your understanding of the game is lacking in this case. A little bit disappointing.
Matpat!! Please do a theory on Duck Season, the VR game. It's mysterious and would be a great episode! Like if you agree and so Matpat can see.
Yes but magic and stuff
wouldnt it still be considered a small blackhole if they compressed the thing that was trying to hurt their trainer? and the attacker would be radiation that would probably stop being radiated and become part of earth again.... and it does say to protect them meaning they might only use this as a last hope type thing as creating blackholes and bypassing the effects of gravity (it does say they dont feel gravity but doesnt mean it wont affect them) they would probably be able to detect human emotion.... and hopefully the emotion of the things that it might need to destroy so it feels bad but....
you don't even need to go that far to prove it wrong: creating a black hole large enough to fit a human would fail at protecting it since said trainer would just get crushed by the presure
Make a video about Entei and if his roars, or a loud enough sound, could make volcanoes erupt.
if there’s is anything about Empoleon , maybe it then ?
I really appreciate the 8-bit horror music.
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Professors in the Pokémon world are dicks.
Isn't the Color black also known as the lack of color, and because a black hole has no light (thus meaning no color) work for a name? Like symbolism or something?
Aren't you overlooking the fact that they can teleport?\n\nWhy bother doing anything with particles to make a black hole when they could potentially just recreate similar spatial distortion withe their phenomenal cosmic mind powers?
your wrong, after the small black hole evaporates it creates an explosion powerful enough to destroy earth.
But Pokémon has no physics\n\n\n\n\n\nU can capture god but can’t burn a tree
Black holes aren't invisible. That's not what invisible means. Or black.\n\nA black hole absorbs all light that crosses it's event horizon. Leaving aside that they arr frequently surrounded by orbiting matter, a more critical point is... They block light!\nThus, if a black hole were to pass in front of something, you would be unable to see through the black hole to the objects behind it.\nThis makes it... Black.\nBlack being the abbsence of colour, or in theory, the absense of visible light.\nPaint cannot ever truly absorb ALL light, but note that the whole point of an object being black as opposed to grey or white is  that it neithrr reflects nor emits large amounts of light. Thus, the less light an object is capable of emitting or reflecting, the closer it is to being truly 'black'.\nFor an object to be invisible however, it has to not be detectable.\nBut a black object held in front of a bright, coloured background is very visible indeed.\nWhat is NOT so visible, is a transparent object, such as glass.\nThus an invisible object would not be one that absorbs or reflects light, but one which transmits it without ever absorbing or distorting any of it.\nNone of which describes a black hole.\nThus, a black hole is indeed black, and not invisible. What renders black holes invisible is trying to look at one against a background with little to no contrast.
But anything can become a black hole just neutron stars is heavy enough to make one about every time earth into a peanut would make a black hole so... aye that's pretty neat
Plz do one about our lord and savior Arceus and the ones more close to him.

one problem, The move moon blast....
You lost me at conservation of matter.
ok 1 i am at 2:22 right now but as we know research and facts can be debunked as new evedence is presented. Things can be thought right and never re evaluated through time as we have seen in history before... that is until someone actually dose look at it more in depth. The Pokedex is rewriten almost every game meaning new information in the pokemon world is found also meaning they know that this process exists and that the knolage on pokemon would be in a grey area untill a set time that they have cold hard facts figured out which could take many many years. also... blub blub
Where is part 2 of indoctrination theory
Wait! One Pokémon?! The Pokedex tells us Lies about ONE Pokémon and you say its full of it!!\nSorry. Nice Episode, but the Title was a bit misleading.
Um... If that is actually how a black hole works (I've followed up on this part of your theory and even theoretical scientist can't really confirm that is actually how a black hole works), wouldn't the black holes sucking in all the light actually make it black not invisible. Or rather we perceive it as black because everything around it is  bouncing off light and in contrast to that it makes the hole actually look black? If it were invisible we would see through it and in order to see through it but still be there it has to refract some sort of light doesn't it?
Gardevoir just turns the enemy pokemon into a black hole, but good game MattPat.
Black is the absence of light.
Can you do a theory on call of duty zombies storyline
Shadowball looks like a black hole, but obviously isn't because video game logic. Fake news.
Honestly I learned so much about black holes I forgot this episode was about pokemon.
what if gardevoir creates the black hole then hugs its trainer so they wouldnt get sucked in?
Can you do a game theory on Ruby Quest? It's a creepy click and point adventure game found on http://evilcorporation.com.br/rubyquest/ and while it seems like there's a pretty easy meaning to find due to it being connected to the poem The Metal Glen by Willam Murdoch, I'm pretty sure you could find something more than worthwhile.

Loved the Good Mythical Morning reference!
10:22, because its 4 O'Clock and im still on my computer and the light of it is bouncing off it
Ok let me explain something the pokedex is an online encyclopaedia you use in the pokemon manga pokemon adventures at the very moment red gets his pokedex oak says  i want you to find all the pokemon and write down everything you learn about them  on to the pokemon encyclopaedia so then ethier you the trainer finds a legendry and write down what they learn about them and if someone found it before them they can lie but you the trainer can fix it you're welcome.
I would love to hear about mew two and the genetics behind him (since he was created and all that jazz).
How about Magikarp or Alakazam or Magcargo? Or Tyranitar, Charmander getting surfed by water and still not dying from no tail fire
I'm gonna have to call bs. Radiation is light, right? Then how could it actually escape a black hole? I'm personally convinced by the idea that it gives off radiation is nothing more than light slingshot off the black hole's gravity like most science fiction. Otherwise, there are actual particles that are not affected by gravity to any extent.\n\nGuess which one seems more likely, but who am I to reasonably question science.
Is there a reason why Earth physics work for the Poké-verse? It didn't in the Assassin's Creed world! [Leap of Faith - video]. \nAlso can anyone tell me if FilmTheory has created a theory based on the Big Hero 6 portals?
matpat plz do mimikyu or type null I'm so intrigued\ni mainly want to see type null
Oh, who knows creating a black hole as an attack is not possible, so I guess a Squirtle squirting out water obviously way more than its body size is complete fine then? Or basically all psychic attacks, totally scientifically possible, eh?
which POKEMON to analyze next? More like next POKEMON to destroy...
I like how he shows eggman running faster than sonic in the intro
Bad science. This channel's theory, not the Pokedex. Completely lacks understanding of singularities. First, the minimum size and energy of small black hole are not certain. Secondly, assuming the rate of Hawking radiation is as predicted a 70 metric ton blackhole would be stable for about a year, 20 metric tons about a second. Something the mass of the moon would basically last longer than the current age of the universe. Now a micro-singularity weighing about 20 metric tons would still be lethal if not due to gravity due to the radiation released we are talking 389,740 megatonnes of TNT worth of energy in a second. The radiation would definitely kill you and probably everything on the planet. A black hole with the energy of a kilogram of TNT would have a mass of like 0.05 micrograms and only need to last a fraction of a second and could still harm any threat to its trainer. The question would be how the hell does it shield its trainer from the radiation. Also, black holes aren't invisible more like if you could actually see it it would be black since black is the absence of light. Now due to gravity bending light, it would kind of be like a lens bending light around it but I am too lazy to work out the math right now. The reason we can't directly see black holes in space is not because they are invisible but because the accretion disk is basically generating massive amounts of radiation mostly in the form of x-rays and the blackhole itself doesn't directly emit light and absorbs the light headed toward it so there is no way to see it since the empty space also doesn't directly emit light. basically a black body against a mostly black background would be invisible.  But I imagine like a marble on a tablecloth if space had way more stars and empty space was not black these black holes would not be invisible. Meaning if an entity ever made one on a planet it could be visible and probably larger than expected since while the sigularity would be microscoping the well creating the lensing could be significantly larger.
Okay, first off,\nDon't question Pokémon. Anything's possible in the world of Nintendo.\nAnd second,\nIt's actually Shadow Ball. Oh well, whatever.\nAlso, I want myself analyzed, please.
I want to see why wormadons (i think i spelled it wrong)can stick in branches,and what insect does it convey as?
Hey can we get a bloodborne theory?
Do Snorlax please! Weighing up to 1000lbs, needing to eat 900lbs of food EVERY DAY!
Snorlax is gonna kill us all ... right?
new theory\n\ngardevoir is an evil psychopath bent on the destruction of the entire earth. or maybe it does this to save the universe by stopping Mewtwo. just a thought.
Wouldn't you be able to see the black hole because of the things that are far behind the black hole?
Can you plz do a theory on pikmin
I hate this the black holes would immidately die bai hawking radation.
Where in new Zealand are you go to south aukland
What happens if you smash nokias into each other in the LHC?
Kinda dont wana ruin ur rant but did u watch the first episode of pokemon? The pokedex is a prototype that is wrong and very incomplete , there are several pokemon just not in it, and Ash receives it to help complete it , and spoiler ash is an idiot that fights rock pokemon with a pikachu.... Just saying Ash doesnt know what a blackhole is....
The issue is that (according to the Pokedex) Gardevoir uses psychokinetic power to distort dimensions in Sapphire, and psychic power in Black/White. So we know that some kind of psychic power is at play, which deals with the realm of nonexistent forces and magic. If that is the case, then the creation and utility of black holes is possible the moment magic is allowed in the context. Magic can be used to justify any questionable claim. How doesn't the world get destroyed when Gardevoir uses makes a black hole? Magic. Why don't pokemon die when they are hit with extremely powerful attacks? Magic. The mention that Gardevoir is not affected by gravity should have already notified you about the involvement of magic. In our understanding of the universe, nothing is unaffected by gravity. Then what is Gardevoir made of? Perhaps magic? \n\nAlso, your claim that science is lying to us with the term 'black holes' is misleading at best. Yes, the term may be inaccurate for its description, but it is not a lie to have a misleading term. Black holes are a shorthand way to describe these things in space; it's a name. \n\nOh, and the title of the video? FULL OF LIES, you say? You have only made a (questionable) claim about one pokemon's pokedex entry. One out of several hundred pokedex entries is not sufficient to make a FULL OF LIES claim. Perhaps a more accurate clickbait title would be Game Theory: The Pokedex LIES TO US. That title is in line with your claim, which I believe is incorrect anyway. \n\nFeel free to discuss and point out any errors in my thinking. I am happy to admit my wrongs. \n\nTL;DR: \nGardevoir uses psychic power, which is essentially magic. Magic can justify anything, including the use of black holes.
seems like this should've been an Austin episode...
Larvitar and the fact that it eats mountains, maybe?
technically since black holes suck in light you would notice a growing darkness near one as the light is removed forming a shadow, which also means looking away from a black hole would be brighter than looking at one (as looking away from one you would observe the light getting sucked into the blackhole and as a result, in your direction). think of it as a light that emits darkness
please I want to see salamance
Matpat can repeat the same statement so many times in one video that a small black hole will form and suck all my interest away.
Here's a Fire Emblem theory: The Weapon Triangle (Swords beats Axes, Axes beats Lances, Lances beat Swords): Can that it work in real life?
So mewtwo is not the strongest pokemon?
Too nerdy for Game Theory? Ha! NOTHING IS TOO NERDY FOR GAME THEORY!!!
make a threoy about how greninja lost to charizrad
man i love me some POKEYMANS!!!!
I like the little subtleties of these videos of his, like when he said black holes suck in the light an image of Light Yagami from death note went into it.
it's pokemon, who's to say that it is the same world where physics are the same? in the pokemon universe we have creatures that tear time and space, that create worlds,  that can travel travel between universes. you look too deep into a world that could be completely different, for someone who uses the multiverse theory often, you should take this into consideration.
Next time you talk about black holes can you slip in the word Spaghettification ?\nNot sure if I spelled it right but it's supposed to be a homogeneous gravitational field caused by extreme tidal forces, in the most extreme cases, near black holes,the stretching is so powerful that no object can withstand it, no matter how strong its components. Within a small region the horizontal compression balances the vertical stretching so that small objects being spaghettified experience no net change in volume.\nWell it says so in Wikipedia.
can someone just tell pat. its just a game ;'))))))))))))))))))))).
Wikipedia is full of alot of lies don't trust it it can be edited by anyone. 0-0
And then you realize that one of gardevoir's attacks is Moonblast..... throwing a black hole at a pokemon?
Does that mean that Rick in Rick and Morty's portal gun has something to do with black holes? Maybe you could do a theory on that, idk.
Um, the pokedex never states that the black holes are SUCCESSFUL in protecting their trainer. And by the way something that is truly black is literally invisible. Black = the absence of light. There is no such thing as black light.
This video is dumb... like... really dumb... dumb enough for me to think about unsubscribing. Also this video is really padded out which could be 1/2 the time.
Mew; Genesis Supernova, Mewtwo: part human, Blaine is the dad where ditto used to be in the DNA
I think Gardevoir uses their psychic powers to make the small black hole stable
what if gardevoir protect her trainers from them self\nyou know\nhuman cant be trusted with their nature?\nlmew
How is Gardevoir the embrace pokemon? She has a freaking blade coming out her chest!
Also tiny black holes explode with light, so they could be used as a weapon.
If black holes absorb light, how are you reading this?
yes a pokemon video. ps flying types are the best.
Isn't pure black an ABSENSE of light?\n\nAlso, the pokedex RECORDS information AUTOMATICALLY, meaning it's not directly written by the professors.
14:36 that picture is my screensaver!!!!!
This was a cool episode because I was fascinated by black holes and wonder if mega Man 9 black hole bomb would work\n\nCan you please do an episode on the regi trio their Pokedex says their industuctable and is it even possible for ice metal and rock to be so
Wait if we can't see a black hole and they accidentally made one and thier just playing POKEMON GO that means..... We die? And wait how do we disable it or destroy it oh wait we can't destroy..... Wow i hate scientists......
i know im breaking the sixth commanmet but where is the 3rd doctor who?
6:40    Is it just me or does that background music sound like Kerbal Space Program?\n\n\nEdit:\nNo its not just me, went further into the vid, MAOR Kerbal Space Program music.
I love the ksp music
Sometimes we get things wrong on this channel.\n\nA way to reduce this is to play the game first before toughing it. Like TF2, or from what I heard, Undertale when you did the ness is Sans... I still don't see it.\n\nAlso, what's the tech of the Pokemon universe? I assume it's the same as ours but they use Pokeballs that can contain things muuuuuch larger than the ball itself, which can compress... What's to stop the gardevoire from keeping the Black hole contained? and wouldn't a Shadow ball look like a Black Hole? It certainly looks like a void. Everyone knows what a shadow ball looks like but the question becomes, what happens if it's altered slightly. If your creating it with mental powers then you can limit the mass going into it and also pull things into it. Say the thing that's trying to kill the trainer.\n\nPokemon's weird and with physics different than our own, it's going to be tough to judge
i LOVE this into
I want to know how eevee can evolve into all of those types and how the heck that happens? I want answers MatPat!!!
Me : I mean hey, don't fight it too much guys. At least Hypnos/Drowzees don't exist.
yay pennywise was on the balloon
I want that kitty face LEGO block! So cute! :3
The Pokedex is FULL OF LIES!\n\nThere was just one lie tho
1 month into a middle school animation class and I can do all of the animation in your videos lol\nNo offense to ur no talent editors
This video taught me so much stuff that tomorrow when i go to school ima tell my teacher how the pokedex lied to us because HE also plays pokemon
AWESOME!! Please make a discord server to discuss these things! \n\nLike if you agree, you can unlike after tier zoo noticed this as proof of the fact that this is no like bait
goddamn it i love this.
Kinda obvious that black tip reef is the worst, and Mr.Snappy is the best\n\nNobody will get this
Great build analysis!  Going to make sure to show this to someone who is just freaked out by these builds...  But, could we get a Honey Badger build analysis?
Please do a build guide on apes.
Yes omg yes I think I came. Is that meta?
Can't wait for SethTheProgrammer to debunk this
Hey can you address the supposed loc ness build, I've never seen the player but some people have apparently
Can you do invasive species and provide an in game context for their playstyle
playing oceans is so damn boring tbh theyre the biggest maps and basically featureless
This game should just be called Call of Duty. Because when you say the initials you just say... Cod... Hehe
I don't know how you feel about Zerg builds, but at up to 40% of the playerbase/Biomass, Ants need to be acknowledged
Pretty sure Greenland shark gets D and goblin shark gets C
That fact about the 3-D vision for the hammer heads tripled me out.... Also could you do a video on the Dog? Or the housecat?
How come ray's weren't included in this patch
Why is he talking about gameplay Is he trolling ?
That's it, I'm finally subbing. Between the funny editing and informative content, this channel is just great. Thanks for making all the videos!
My favorite shark build got the top of S tier!!!! I feel like I won a prize hahaha
Surely the Gummy Shark makes F tier, Its a smaller, lower stated nurse shark.
Lol I love how you make it sound like it's a video game 🎮
Do a vid on humans
dude do a tier list for  bears
Awesome channel. I'd request you to cover cryptids, but I'm not sure if it is just hearsay or just a very restricted closed beta thing. Severe lack of gameplay footage doesn't help too.
Could you please make a video where you create a random build?
Yo, somebody start working on an animal rpg ASAP! You can use these for reference
Smash mouth defiantly ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
Please do a video on the tankiest builds!
Will all my Owl mains please stand up
Can we get comparison between the crocodile and alligator builds? Which is better at dominating their respective biomes?
DID YOU JUST MAKE A WOBBLING JOKE! Subscribed.
My favorite shark is the frilled shark, it's older than dirt and looks like it.
I know you didn't just make an entire channel that's stolen from casually explained
Can you do a video on best sleeper builds? (A.K.A best builds that shouldn't work but work extremely well)
Were domestic cats coming or was that just a joke in the video on cats? :-p
What GAME IS THIS??
Whale sharks are one of my favorite animals I love them so much
When are you making a patreon
Hey can you do a vid about Hyenas?
Mako sharks are B at most, They're delicious to humans.
So happy you're getting recognition! Your content is great!
I like this video, because I love Sharks. But some of your facts werent quite right. Such as Nurse Sharks are pretty fierce, they can suck Conchs and SeaTurtles from their shells. And not all shark need to keep moving some species can pump blood over their gills.\nCongrats on all the subs!
as a tiger shark player i often get confused by the human players waste and i eat it thinking it was food
I knew I recognized that song from Fishing Trawler on RuneScape
Dude, you are the channel I've always needed without knowing it.
Will you do a beetle tier list? There's so many guilds.
I feel although the complete removal of Megalodon players/class was completely unwarranted. While yes it would be strong in the current meta it would still have it's weaknesses such as their ease of being team shot. Like if you agree.
Can you discuss the Bat builds?
Where does the Goblin shark place? I wanna start a new aquatic build but I'm not really sure where to start and the Goblin shark has always intrigued me.
I don't think i've subscribed so quickly to a channel.
Is he talking about a game
I think we need a legendary character build video where you cover Bigfoot and all the other mythical builds. Could be fun
Great videos! Can you make a banned tier list video?
What about high tier bird builds
plant tier list!! I know its a simplistic mode but you can play on a toaster
Hey TZ, Do you mind doing a video on humans? Listen I've been a human player for a long time now and their viability is inarguable but lately I've been getting sick of these griefing clans    and their bullshit. It's gotten so bad that I'm honestly considering switching over to Dog, its a much simpler play style. Keep up the good work!
How about a brief overview of each tier?
how am i only now finding this channel ? a really neat approach to categorizing and teaching about different families/ genera/ species of animals !
I remain impressed at how quickly your production quality rises. Great job with the voice editing!
please make more intros like that lol
what game is this
Any plans for anti-meta discussion?
i would also like to mention the great whites cloaking ability. the top of it is painted grey so that players above the shark looking down have a much harder time  spotting it against the black background. this coupled with the great whites power charge and moderate intelligence level (big cat level), boasts the build as a stealth power attacker
What about goblin sharks? Where would you place those on the tier list?
Where can I find the character select screen. Looking to make a stealth build
We have a cat tier list. Dog tier list? I've seen some good dog players in my day. How would you rate the intelligence of the different dogs?
Do one with humans
The runescape references in this video lol, sea shanty 2, the yellow text, and the hit point splats, I love it
Your all a bunch of newbs, I main elephant which is a perfectly balanced tank when it comes to strength, speed, health and intelligence. Elephant class should be a top tier. The only weakness to the elephant class is probably the human class but they are too overpowered to begin with in the first place.
The RS music memories of getting PJed.
could you do a video on the spider tier list? and i mean true spiders, not tarantulas.
I love the references to smash bros in between each shark tier or type.
Can you do an insect tier list?
I've heard a lot of rumors that I hope you can confirm or deny did the Chicken Class of the Egg Class come first?
What game is he talking about
Whale tier video would be nice. Killer whales and other toothed whales stack really high intelligence bonuses and often travel in numbers. Excellent early and late game potential.
Just gotta say, awesome idea. Love this. Don't stop.
8:12 woahh that’s a fucking scary sight (poor turtle)
lmaooo this is so original and funny
Lmao i love this guy
Insect tier list please
Bears please
Do humans next.
Thumbs up for chip skylark
Nerf the sharks buff crocodile
Can you discuss the bathypelagic metagame?
*SHINEY TEEF INDEAD*
*sheds a tear*\nR.i.p Fairyodd parents
love the overwatch references!
honeybadgers and apex predators
Awesome video!
melee reference!
Ayyy! You made it on trending. Congrats, dude!
Dog wold tier
haha, this is hilarious!! subbed
Liked for RuneScape references.
Do turtles next
Now THIS; This is quality content!
Humans: the lucio builds. You just kinda exist but are untouchable by most other builds, except for the symmetra build (mosquitos). and can sometimes clutch it by lasting a long time on the point with its massive amount of sustain
my suggestion would be bird builds
So one of your favorite builds for sharks is the Cookie Cutter Build? Pretty casual.
AWESOME!! Please make a discord server to discuss these things! \n\nLike if you agree, you can unlike after tier zoo noticed this as proof of the fact that this is no like bait
Cant tell if this is an actual game or he's making it like a game.
Like if you’re a seal player
thank you for finally trying to do something that games have not been able to do in a long time at least for me. If only there was a real game to help drive home the point and actually sparked the interest for everyone else good luck to you I hope it goes well man
What tier would the Goblin Shark fall into?
I don't like the retro theme of this channel. I feel like you'll get more subs if you update your intro and thumbnails
That background music is a variation of Runescape music
holy shit this channel is amazing
Could you make a video about the players in Australia? They seem brutal AF
You've made a video on the feline mains, now do one for canis mains
Runescape is dead. But i just heard old school is coming to mobile this Christmas👌
Hey! I'm from Wautoma, Wisconsin and we recently got shout out in one of the videos. Milty Wilty.
It's about 10:30 at night and I've smiled more from this video than I have all day, even when I pushed that Minotaur off a cliff in Destiny 2\nI really thought this would be some shitty countdown video, it's actually an informative and hilarious video. Keep up the good work!\n+1
could you make a top ten for S tier?
Do a bird orders tier list
Hi there,\nNow i've been a long time player of the Jaguar class, and this channel has been a great help for me when min maxing my stats and gear, so thank you!\n\nI was just wondering why you have not yet mentioned the Human Civilization expansion pack that was introduced 20,000 years ago? As a long time player of Earth, i'd like to know your thoughts on how that expansion changed the game and whether or not Human is a viable class.
Where’s that dog tier list?
This is something that, when I watched, I was surprised no one else had done it better
alligators or crocodiles would be cool
Random stuff\n \n \n \n _My shiny teeth and me_
OMG IS THAT INTRO SONG SHINY TEETH AND ME FROM FAIRLY ODD PARENTS!!!???
Please do a Tier list for Owls
Wait is this about a game?
What the fuck is this even?
The question for which guild invented Bite. LOL you're a genius.
I think that you should discuss the deadliest build in the current meta: bacteria. Although a slightly scummy class (because most other classes can’t really do anything to prevent being killed by bacteria), it is definitely the most prevalent class for those players who enjoy having extremely high K/D ratios without exactly playing the objective (that being gaining of knowledge and longevity). I think many would be surprised about the high stealth, mobility, and damage that the bacteria class boasts.
Do a spider build my guy
Dude, I love how you describe the animals in all you videos. Keep making it sound like a video game, I just subscribe today.
wow rood there are a lot of good things in wisconsin ok\nbut ++ on the tier list my dude B)
What the hell is this video? I don’t understand what’s going on
Bull sharks are stronger than Smashmouth pass it on
Emergency Room: Real Life Rescues is my favourite shark build
All of the videos in your recommended vids were smash bros things... 🤔\nAre you perhaps a Fox main?
If ymany of you guys use amino you shoukd join my TierZoo community! http://aminoapps.com/invite/SKG2B9PCHH
Personally, I thought Bull sharks should've been in S. The ability to swim in freshwater makes them a dominant force in both water types.
Could you do a reef ecosystem tier list??
can you analyze dogs? Ive noticed they are in S tier, but obviously the diversity of the species is incredible. I would love to see the spread between different types of dogs in the tier!
As of oct 2nd this video is 47 on trending\nSo HITMAN type video confirmed
Only good thing about living in Wisconsin! My cheese and I will fight you!
Do a video turtle tiers.
Im actually trying out the Homo sapien build and i wanted to sak your opinion on it.\nI kinda suck with it so some tips would be appreciated.
but what about the massive late game champ the Greenland Shark?
Can you do a pigeon or bat analysis, please? Great channel, btw.
So what is this
I know you did a video talking about if it's possible to play as a dinosaur, but could you try a video talking about actual dinosaurs and how they placed in the meta?
This was great video man! I just found your channel and have watched all your videos. Brilliant way of educating others.
Do a video on the urban biome, where several players (pigeons, racoons, rats and others) found ways to bypass the human defense mechanisms!\n\nOverall great channel, found it today and was sad to see there were only a couple of videos!
Depth...... It's A good game
I love how you do this as if it's a game 😂😂😂
I bet you get this request a lot, but pls do humans before the civilization expansion.
A human and primate tier list would be lit
What game is he talking about
You know I heard that sea shanty 2 asap
I would love a mmo simulation game that is an entire ecosystem
You should cover the viability of lizards on all servers
Will you do reviews of patched-out builds like the Dunkleosteus from 382 million years ago?
What’s this for?
As a dedicated sawshark main, we build for it because of one important philosophy, SOYO. SOYO stands for Swaggin On Your Opponent. I don't understand why tier lists don't understand this.
What game is his
Would you Consider the Human class, as overpowered as it is, to be a griefing class given Human Players' tendency to camp and subjugate lower tier classes and new players?
Fish Tiers! Hearing about the Marlin makes me wonder what other fish fit in what tier.
Can you talk about humans?
Greenland shark should be here..
runescape music in the background, wobbling reference, i'm cumming. I love this channel. Did you watch GT-X? Also congrats on the growth, Jesus. I remember thinking your count was way too low like a month ago, and, well, looks like it's made some progress
I saw this and was like SHAAAARRKKSSS YESSSS XD
So, where in the tier list do mosquitoes fit in?
I've always loved the hammerhead shark build; glad to see it getting recognized in the current meta.
Utub finnaly know what I like? This meta vid is just amazing! I know what to play in Sharkwatch!
Please do canine builds like the famous house dog or vicious wolves and hyenas
Yo cover and make a video about heavy support players like for example I like playing as elephant and playing with some of my friends who also play as elephant and we clear the server and get so much exp so fast! I'm already level 40+!!
why do people still play marine mammals with no defense? i.e. manatees, whales and all those guys? they're just floating exp.
Can we get a reptile class video
Birds of pretty tier list
I don't remember if you talked about the blue shark and if you did not what would they be
Do mosquitoes next, low tier but unbelievably good troll build
LEMON SHARK
Nerf sharks pls (?)
The r/videos mods jab made me wheeze.
But rays are sharks...
Human build analysis?
Sand sharks?
PERFECT
Big cat tier list
Loving this channel. :D
👍
Fox
another awesome entry, keep them coming.
Do human
Discuss artic animals
SNAKE TIER NEXT PLEASE
You should analyze horseshoe crabs
No goblin shark?
I'm confused
#44 on trending
Whales!
DO PRIMATES(maybe include bigfoot and yeti?)
DO BUGS
God tier shark the megalodon op.
Great memes.
the runescape music though
Wow my channel is mentionned? That's incredible! Totally unexpected! Thanks a ton it really means a lot :D I truly appreciate it!!!
Since you Apparently take Suggestions according to your About Sections, Maybe you should do one on Extinct Sharks (E.G Cardabiodon, Cretoxyrhina, Megalodon, Otodus, Hybodus Etc)
were are spiders on the tier list
Objective and critical analyses on the domesticated or trained pets.
Which low/bottom tier do you think has the best matchup against a top tier? Personally I think Shrikes have one of the best matchups against Bees. I'd say it's somewhere in the range of 70:30 Shirke's favor.
Could we have a tier list on the animals that live in the human made environments? I main the pigeon, it's nothing spectacular but it's good
I still think game sharks are f tier
I know saw shark is low tier but its fun to pvp against the occasional passerby swordfish build.
The parasite shark is a real bastard... His moves are cheap as hell.\n\n... Little sucker!
Ironic that the cookiecutter shark is such a unique build.
Got recommended this...im not mad about it
Yo, Bio major, graduated spring this year, UO, wondering take on invasives such as nutria, blackberries, and domesticated cats (wheres that video already?!?!)?
Where the heck is the goblin shark on the tier list?
Not to be that guy but some sharks can passively regain stamina without moving
You touched on the cookie cutter shark as a sort of parasite, but what do you think about parasites as a whole? As diverse as they are, there should be a lot to talk about
Cnidaria: build suggestions: Portuguese man of war, box jelly, and green hydra
what about the god tier megalodon
Someone please tell me what the fuck this is
I really want a Salamander discussion, specifically the Giant Chinese and Giant Japanese Salamanders.
hey, you should do a whale/dolphin/porpoise tier list! i wanna see that sky-high HP whale species, fam.
F tier sharks actually exist. Like the salmon shark and porbeagle.
Do you think it's fair that some animals get passive bonuses from aesthetics, which was designed to be purely cosmetic? For example tiger's stripes that also give a bonus to STL?
Can you do a video about an obscure prehistoric animal?
how about a vid on the pros and cons of a specialized scavenger build?
can we get some aerial dps analysis? interested in an owl build, but hard to ignore the sheer strength of the oh so popular falcon and eagle builds
Good good stuff!  Keep it up!
You should do a Vespid tier!
Would you consider making a video about what would happen if we banned humans? I've been trying to find a server without them for years.
Rodent tier list when? It would be very beneficial to those of us with rodent alts looking to succeed.
You should do a video about carnivorous plants
You should do a video on builds like the honey badger or wombat
What’s the name of this game
Yeah ever since release us cookie cutter sharks have been hard countered by most other bigger sharks.. like buff please
Who wants to see a freshwater fish tier list? I know they aren’t the meta right now, but certain builds can be very effective.
What would be the best build for dps flanker mains. I'm interested in trying out this platform any help is appreciated.
What tier is the Goblin Shark?
Its like you suck at cooking but with animals
what fucking game is this? is it just real life animals put into teers and shit?
thank you for finally trying to do something that games have not been able to do in a long time at least for me. If only there was a real game to help drive home the point and actually sparked the interest for everyone else good luck to you I hope it goes well man
You've yet to cover any air builds up to this point (birds)
>playing any marine class and not speccing into deep-sea survival\n>plebs don't know about the goblin shark
This is an amazing channel! But what about frilled sharks though. Either way love the content
Insect teir would be cool, also the blob fish
I know these are meant as jokes but they make sooo much sense. Except the crabs stuff
I'd like to see how insect players compare in the Meta. I understand that cicada players might be very low tier support, but what about the speedy tiger beetle. I swear if they put more focus into their size, they'd be faster than the speedy cheetah build.\n\n(Note: entomology gamer thats looking to help.)
r/videos mods - Sharpiness 0. They had it coming for a while.
Yo, a video on symbiotic relationships would be super interesting.
Jellyfish vid? Loving all of your content
What place do Fox and Falco have in this game?
i'd like to have your opinion on the high risk high reward playstyle of the salmons, especially when it comes to spawning minions.
What tier would the Goblin Shark fall into?

Can you do one on ants? Or just insects in general cuz I reckon ants should be high tier A at least, probably S?
Thank god for the recommended tab. This idea for videos is so fucking genius.
Forgot humans another deadly rival
Pangolin, anteater type builds
4:25 HOLD UP NOW
Love the vids dude
Do insects next, or wolverines.
Apes. Canines. Dragons.

What game is he talking about
I would love to see a video discussing the players that have unlocked food storage on the intelligence progression and how that has turned out for them. This strategy has produced some really cool results I think.\n\nOther ideas I have are a tier video for players who have maxed out various branches of the flight tree, or terrestrial characters that took the endurance branch of the mobility tree as far as they could.\n\nThese videos are a great concept and well made. Hopefully they are as fun to produce as to watch. Keep up the good work.
please I need to know the tier list for birds of prey
Nice video man! Keep it up. Make a Monkey Tier video please. :)
How about a video on the Yellowstone meta and how it's changed
Can we talk about the deep water server shark the goblin shark? I mean clearly it has the strongest aoe fear. And it is passive. I mean have you ever seen a goblin shark. That thing looks terrifying.
Since marlin are talked about so much in this video, could you make a video based soley on the marlin build?
Talk about how Pugs are an S teir Dog class
I've heard rumours of an unknown (?) Tier, what are your thoughts on this?
The short fin mako is top tier. Bottom line. So much disrespect. Smh
Are there any top tiers that break the conventions of the general meta - game? Generally high intelligence and pack behaviors are thought to be hallmarks of a high tier player, right?
So I main the cane toad and I don't know what the matchup is against sea creatures. Could you do a matchup video for characters
Where are jellies in the meta? Are they even playable?
Would like to see a video about bees, wasps, and hornets. I can't be the only one who's sick and tired of being griefed by these players
I think you should move the Great White down to an A rank. The reason being, Great Whites have this huge disadvantage of being sensitive to climates. They seem to be one of the only characters that will take damage in captivity even after being released, so bad in fact that no player has ever been able to survive long after something like that. Also they have a really competitive early game stage, where new players have to battle inside the mother to see which one will get to continue playing, which greatly drops the amount of players.
Gotta say, you missed one of the best builds the Greenland Shark. It has the highest HP clocking in at at least 300 years, maybe more, they have an anti freezing buff which makes them immune to become frozen, and have one of the best smell stats of all the Sharks.
YO I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THAT WHIP SHARK BUILD EXISTED\n\nBRB ABOUT TO REINVEST SOME SAVED EVOLUTION POINTS
Do a video about the Killer whales .. they are solo OP
Hey! I really enjoyed this video, being someone who has an alt in the Ocean Servers (Shark Guild, Thresher Shark build specifically)\nI was curious about a couple insect builds in particular, though, so I figured this would be the best place to ask (not a huge fan of insects, so I avoid most of their boards). What's the deal with Bees? Why would they spec into an attack that fatally damages themselves?
Tier zoo please make an intelligence class rating for us Intelligent builds
subreddit mod tier list, F:  /r/videos D: /r/smoobypost C: /r/me_irl B: /r/highqualitygifs A: /r/casualconversation S: /r/natureisfuckinglit
Ugh, I accidentally chose the human class, and I can't get back to the character select screen. Help?
Please cover birds of prey. They seem to be hard to kill with no AA guns added yet. Also cover turtles and if u can maybe those ancient croc-like salamanders
I really love your videos
I'm a honey badger main and very content how high do you rate them?
Since you Apparently take Suggestions according to your About Sections, Maybe you should do one on Extinct Sharks (E.G Cardabiodon, Cretoxyrhina, Megalodon, Otodus, Hybodus Etc)
were are spiders on the tier list
Objective and critical analyses on the domesticated or trained pets.
Can we get a legendary character analysis?
Hey, how is meta tier different from conservation status, aren't species that survived to this point meta by default?
I am so lost bc I just found this in my recommendations
Hey when will we get the frog tier list video?
I'm loving all the melee and overwatch references, as well as runescape text. Keep up the good work my man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThou I wouldn't mind some tf2 references.
I'm thinking depth... Didn't know the whip was a real thing for thresher XD
About which game are you talking ?
Someone I know was recommended to watch this video. Hence, I am watching this shit and cant believe you already have 175k subs.
Are we going to get a domestic housecat video?
As a long time rat player, I would like to see the best rodent builds.
Which low/bottom tier do you think has the best matchup against a top tier? Personally I think Shrikes have one of the best matchups against Bees. I'd say it's somewhere in the range of 70:30 Shirke's favor.
Could we have a tier list on the animals that live in the human made environments? I main the pigeon, it's nothing spectacular but it's good
I still think game sharks are f tier
I know saw shark is low tier but its fun to pvp against the occasional passerby swordfish build.
The parasite shark is a real bastard... His moves are cheap as hell.\n\n... Little sucker!
Ironic that the cookiecutter shark is such a unique build.
Got recommended this...im not mad about it
Yo, Bio major, graduated spring this year, UO, wondering take on invasives such as nutria, blackberries, and domesticated cats (wheres that video already?!?!)?
Where the heck is the goblin shark on the tier list?
Not to be that guy but some sharks can passively regain stamina without moving
You touched on the cookie cutter shark as a sort of parasite, but what do you think about parasites as a whole? As diverse as they are, there should be a lot to talk about
Cnidaria: build suggestions: Portuguese man of war, box jelly, and green hydra
what about the god tier megalodon
Someone please tell me what the fuck this is
I fucking hate bull sharks!! They always attack me and i am not even playing the shark game.
I really want a Salamander discussion, specifically the Giant Chinese and Giant Japanese Salamanders.
hey, you should do a whale/dolphin/porpoise tier list! i wanna see that sky-high HP whale species, fam.
F tier sharks actually exist. Like the salmon shark and porbeagle.
Do you think it's fair that some animals get passive bonuses from aesthetics, which was designed to be purely cosmetic? For example tiger's stripes that also give a bonus to STL?
Can you do a video about an obscure prehistoric animal?
how about a vid on the pros and cons of a specialized scavenger build?
can we get some aerial dps analysis? interested in an owl build, but hard to ignore the sheer strength of the oh so popular falcon and eagle builds
Good good stuff!  Keep it up!
You should do a Vespid tier!
Would you consider making a video about what would happen if we banned humans? I've been trying to find a server without them for years.
Rodent tier list when? It would be very beneficial to those of us with rodent alts looking to succeed.
You should do a video about carnivorous plants
You should do a video on builds like the honey badger or wombat
You've yet to cover any air builds up to this point (birds)
>playing any marine class and not speccing into deep-sea survival\n>plebs don't know about the goblin shark
No Dog Sharks?
Nice game
You gimme that bear build?
Analyze humans bruh
5:55 My sides
This is an amazing channel! But what about frilled sharks though. Either way love the content
Insect teir would be cool, also the blob fish
I know these are meant as jokes but they make sooo much sense. Except the crabs stuff
8:12 r/videos mods are worse then f tier
What tier are goblin sharks?
What would be the best build for dps flanker mains. I'm interested in trying out this platform any help is appreciated.
What’s the name of this game
Yeah ever since release us cookie cutter sharks have been hard countered by most other bigger sharks.. like buff please
Who wants to see a freshwater fish tier list? I know they aren’t the meta right now, but certain builds can be very effective.
Are human builds viable
Thank god for the recommended tab. This idea for videos is so fucking genius.
Forgot humans another deadly rival
Do an Orca Build...Pls
0:40 daaamn 😂😭
Do bats!
Pangolin, anteater type builds
Love the vids dude
Do insects next, or wolverines.
Apes. Canines. Dragons.
love the overwatch references
threshers are fucking awesome
Monkeys next.
Any noteworthy DLC recently?
Unplayable characters/banned character choices - Mythical beasts/Dragons
BEST. CHANNEL. EVER. PERIOD.
Can you do one on ants? Or just insects in general cuz I reckon ants should be high tier A at least, probably S?
It's a prequel guys they had Dutch in the trailer
Van der Linde was a side character that wasn't as important as Bill Williamson or Javier Escuela.\n\nAlllllrighhhht, then...
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info
When is bully 2 coming i am excited about that ☺
magnificent 7 was a great movie
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?
For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3.
Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
I seen this trailer
Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.
yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
I swear this game better then the GTA series
Is it for PC though.?
This is what happens when you put two idiots in charge..
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
It's just a cut scene of cowboys eating at camp, this is how games get hyped beyond all reason, rockstar games or not.
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
It's comes out in auttum
there was a morality system in red dead redemption
Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer
Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
lol Marty was all over the place in this video
I can finally hang myself in peace.
I really hope it’s not all online
That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
How did they not recognize Dutch
I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game.
Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
yo I cant wait for it
No game no hype, those are the rules.
Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April.
hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters...
He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you...
“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol
Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
I only care about multiplayer!
can preorder now. o yeah were close
throwing my money at the screen, want to pre-order, but can't find it on STEAM????????????
are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
it could be as late as june.
I'm betting and hope one of the  main characters is a the native american with the rag sack.
THE HYPE TRAIN is gone!!!! this is a must!!!
Marty's hands keep shaking, is that hype?
I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking.
How will they work shark cards into this...
Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much
Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
DID YOU HAVE TO PUT A TIMER IN THE BEGINNING
The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day
Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
Best open world game ever Coming right up
RDR2 will look and play best on Xbox One X!\nStay tuned, pc to run this @ 0p & 0fps.
Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of..
any players who havent played rdr but likes cowboys?
Coming 2019
I'm playing this on Xbox one X can't wait
I want gta 6
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2

Fully torqued
PC?

The baddest mofo in red dead is still Juan Sierra: Quien quiere peleyar con migo!

What's interesting from both trailer's is the wild life. They seem to have their own eco system where they'll hunt, feed, dehydrate etc. In Red Dead 1 the animals will just stand there and any predators will hunt you and nothing else. But in Red Dead 2 trailer The predators look as though they'll will hunt & kill other prey as well as your self. What's more interesting is the way this new eco system will impact on your horses. Do they get hungry, thirsty or even die of natural causes? Cos' maintaining your horse is a whole new gameplay mechanic not encountered before and will be very interesting to see in game.
Was that captured on a high-end PC? I'd love if it did, but I doubt it'll look like that on my PS4.
You guys are literally oblivious lol that was a younger Dutch in the trailer so this is going to be a prequel and you can bet that john is going to make an appearance
I can't wait for the multiplayer coop that we just couldn't get right in GTA\n*SOMEBODY WANTS TO JOIN YOUR POSSE*
That man with the magnificent mustache is Dutch motherfuckin Van Der Linde.
Will this have shark cards??! I WANNA BUY A COTTON FARM
I AM\nHYPED FOR THIS 👀🤓
How stupid are these guys! That politician is Dutch, the leader of the gang!!! ARGHHH And its definitely a prequel!
If you're the supposed experts that are going to analyze the trailer how about at least reading the synopsis of the first one on the wiki? 😑
We don't know if it's a prequel Young Dutch was in the trailer you dopes...
How did these guys not hear him say Always Dutch.
It's a prequel guys they had Dutch in the trailer
Van der Linde was a side character that wasn't as important as Bill Williamson or Javier Escuela.\n\nAlllllrighhhht, then...
My god, this rampant speculation is why people always get over-hyped and are ultimately disappointed in games. Temper your expectations, people. I get it, you're excited, but let's be a little realistic here.
Seriously? We knew it was a prequel when they showed us the first trailer.
Wow. You really know nothing. Of course it is a prequel and from the trailer it is crystal clear that it is. Do you prepare for such a show at all?
Just look to the right the trailer has already been released
Watching this while in a lecture session lol
Will the be available on the Sega Genesis?
Wow only fuckin 6 months because of delay...... smh rockstar
hey ign your description says its a sequel LMAO ITS PREQUEL
what an abysmal analysis. took them like ten minutes to realize who dutch is and that its a prequel. and they only found out because chat told them... pretty pathetic
I feel like the kid in the trailer is john and this character, Morgan, will at several points cross paths with John. I think this new character is gonna betray Dutch at some point and maybe Marston will be the guy that kills him.
Only real ones watch the entire 24 min loading screen
Rockstar isn't EA or Ubisoft.\n\nHype
Off topic but does anybody know any good STD clinics around?
Tom Sellick character   ? thats Dutch and he was the main villain ...did you guys even play the game?
They are so good at covering games that they do'nt remember Dutch, and that he is old in RDR, and here we see Dutch way younger, so props to IGN for being so good at seeing everything but the obvious...
“Morgan” calls the man at the end “Dutch” I’m presuming Dutch Vanderlin.....
YOU GOT SOME MONEY FOR ME BOY
stil not on pc
hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
Dutch Van der Linde was anything but a minor character. He was the leader of Dutch's gang and John Marston's boss before the original Red Dead Redemption.
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
Can we have Indians in this one
You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought
Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?

I was hoping for\nSpring 2018 but to tide you over Red Dead Redemtion remaster this holiday for Ps4, Xbox One, Switch and PC!
If I cant climb up or paraglide off that cliff, i wont buy!
AT LAST\nIVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
But they already released the new trailer....?
I want a GTA5 style online game where you can ride with your posse and do co op bank heist's and train robberies. Cant wait for this game, wish it was out before Christmas.
Is it just me or does the badass stab lady look like bonnie mcfarlane from rdr?

Watching theses two grasp at straws try to gleam anything from a one minute trailer is ridiculous

You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought
These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking.
How will they work shark cards into this...
Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much
single player dlcs will always be better than online ones! always!
Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day
Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
Best open world game ever Coming right up
RDR2 will look and play best on Xbox One X!\nStay tuned, pc to run this @ 0p & 0fps.
Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of..
I'm playing this on Xbox one X can't wait

Is it for PC though.?
What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info
When is bully 2 coming i am excited about that ☺
magnificent 7 was a great movie
Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?
For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3.
Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
I seen this trailer
Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously.
yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
I swear this game better then the GTA series
This is what happens when you put two idiots in charge..
It's just a cut scene of cowboys eating at camp, this is how games get hyped beyond all reason, rockstar games or not.
It's comes out in auttum
there was a morality system in red dead redemption
Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer
Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
lol Marty was all over the place in this video
I can finally hang myself in peace.
I really hope it’s not all online
That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
How did they not recognize Dutch
I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game.
Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about.
No game no hype, those are the rules.
Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April.
hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters...
He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you...
“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol
Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
I only care about multiplayer!
can preorder now. o yeah were close
throwing my money at the screen, want to pre-order, but can't find it on STEAM????????????
are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch.
it could be as late as june.
Can we have Indians in this one
You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought
hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years.
Boy I hope its not like Destiny
single player dlcs will always be better than online ones! always!
Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)
3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2

A random thought... If Ditto has a set mass(mass can't be created), his weight shouldn't be able to change when he takes the form of a larger Pokemon, then a plain Ditto should have the same weight and mass as a Ditto that takes the form of a Snorelax. \n\nNow Here's a question! How large of a pokemon or object would Ditto have to transform into, until his density, is less than the air around him, and he begins to float? \n\nPlease upvote, I'm curious about this one...
Pretty sure every Poke-tuber on Youtube has done at least one video covering this exact subject matter.
15 mins on black holes and y a Pokémon can't make one.
How about the Pokédex entry for Magcargo? It claims that it is 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit which would make it literally impossible for normal humans to even get near the thing without immediately frying to death. Also, the entries aren't written by the professors. They, instead, have children go out and collect their data for them which seems extremely unprofessional and thus, could lead to tons of misinformation within the dex. Misinformation that, as far as we know, the professors never bother to check and fix.
Legit \nHello everybody want to get free stuff download Verydice and start rolling use my code 1177158
Hey matpat, MATPAT! STAT! So we have the pokedex, right? And we, a ten year old kid are filling it out, NOT the professors so basically we're writing the entry's therefore making things up because, say we see a gardevoir use shadow ball and immediately think it's a black hole?
Magearna plase...realy: How da heal does that thing moves?!?!?
Honestly would love to see Eevees or hell maybe one of the alolan pokemon?
What if pokemon is magic and they is no science to it.\nWhat if pokemon have inner power that can create and control energy.
My one point of contention with your reasoning on this MatPat is that you assume the black hole has to be stable. More than likely the black holes it would use as attacks are meant to strike quickly, (most likely within a fraction of a second, since while they're turn based in game, Pokemon battles are generally shown to be relatively fast paced in the show), before dissipating. This would allow it to attack and deal severe damage to its opponent, without going to the incredibly ridiculous lengths necessary to create a stable black hole. Not saying your information about black holes or your research is incorrect, but rather that you're not considering the practical application of how it would attack with said black holes. Still a good episode over all, and I'm looking forward to more as there are a lot of entries that make little sense, but I did have to point out my personal disagreement with your over all conclusion on this one......
HAHAHAHA I just noticed you are using the Kerbal Space Program soundtrack! Nice choice for a space episode!
Wouldnt its hug kill you via the massive red spike on its chest
Matpat: the Pokedex is full of lies\nme: click\nMatpat: just 1 example
Black holes are product of scientists imagination.
5:30  “Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.”
Your setting yourself up for failure in another video. Then you won't have the pokedex to lean on for backup evidence
Soundtrack sponsored by kerbal space program. Is there a game theory on that coming?
Moltres like how does the fire stay alight when moltres is flying super fast
heres the first thing. Pokemon is fictional, it doesnt always need to follow every real life law of physics
Or maybe gardeviour creates something that can suck in stuff, but isn't a black hole, and they just call it a black hole.
Be nice to my creepy Wisp Monster, MatPat! She's sensitive...\n\nAnyways, what about Swampert? Towing yachts at jet ski speeds seems a bit far fetched for the guy, right?
came for the pokemon, stayed for the science.
Matty Patty you're forgetting one very important thing. The pokedex isn't written by the professors, but by the 10 year olds they give them to. That's why if your character only sees a Pokemon but doesn't catch it only the picture and some very limited (basically nothing) information is added. Its only when the trainer catches the Pokemon that the entry is filled out. Its not lies, but the limited knowledge (see myths and lore) and over active imagination of a 10 year old trainer. I'm disappointed in you Pattycakes, you're better than this.
Who came first: Arceus or Mew?
But i cant read D:\n\nIf you are wonderong, lies means read that in german.\n\nOh and btw, no one is mentioning that Mat is doing   scientific theorys again?
I think the keywords are psychic power. Maybe it's psychic power are dense enough to create a black hole. Don't forget it's a while different universe so not everything is the same as it is in ours.
Wait the dex is filled by the trainers so perhaps that pokemon is just using shadow ball or dark big bang attack and the trainer being just a kid doesn't know any better.
Trust me, grab nearly ANY ghost type Pokemon and you have one creeypasta filled episode. Like Yamask (It's mask is it's former human face.) or even Phantump (The soul of a child that died in the woods and then possessed a tree.).
10:21 if black holes absorb light how are you reading this
Can you do a theory on doraemon especially of bamboo copter and anywhere door
4:00 there is no such thing as black light bouncing into your eye. Black is the absence of color, where a material partially absorbs light. It just so happens that black holes absorb all light. If black holes were invisible, we'd be able to see straight through them.
The catch is that It was admitted that black holes don't actually exist, given that any amount of matter smashed into such a small space would begin to rotate, and the smaller it got, the faster it would rotate, until the kinetic force of the spin was pushing just as hard as the gravity was pulling, causing it to simply rotate infinitely. Therefore, black holes don't actually exist. At best they make certain mathematical problems possible, but that's about it.
uhhh question: what if gardevoir could compress the mass of something small (similar mass to a bullet) inside the danger whatever it may be?\nsure it would quickly evaporate but in the fraction of a second that it would exist it could burn the danger away (altough I know nothing about black holes so maybe I'm wrong)\nor I don't know... gardevoir could compress THE DANGER ITSELF! once again it would evaporate, but that would work in the trainner's favor would it not?
The moon could NOT become a stable Black Hole.\nTo become a Black Hole and stay stable you need 2 things:\nMass (around 150x our sun)\nAnd a supernova that crushes that mass into a space as tiny as a tennisball. \nYou cant create a black Hole that can stay alive out of sth as small as the moon or 20x our sun my friend :P
Can you do a book theory of the Jedi order book series the yusa vong Wars please it’s a Star Wars book please
So gardevor is the most usless pokemon but could also be the most devistating to the earth...........................i might go live on the sun now ( this is the year 8099)
What if it makes a black home out of the other Pokemon? It would immediately disintegrate and stop the threat. OR it could use a black hole made from air, causing an effect kind of similar to cavitation (that thing that makes mantis shrimps so powerful) not to mention suffocation or collapsed lungs.
Just saying, but the Pokedex says that Gardevoir will give its own life for its trainer. Meaning that Gardevoir still does its job(sort of, at the expense of everything on planet Earth).
Good. Thank you. Now I have a more recent account where you admit you are human and that you make mistakes for that plethora of idiots who keep pretending that theory is a shield to pretend you are always right.
The liar here is you! The Pokedex isn't written by the Professors, it's empty when you get it. They task YOU with filling it in! Oak says he is too old to go and do the research himself, so you have to find all the Pokémon and report back
7:57 Our house... In the middle of our house-
hey thanks for making a pokemon video is my birthday and i em pokemon crazy so thank you hoop to see and here moor from you love you
I dont see any problem with the smaller black holes that fizzle out? That says nothing against the dex entry.
Pokemon Sun and Moon? You could continue the multiple universe theory!
Woah, that Aladin reference is actually a perfect way to quickly sum up black holes, props for that Matt! How did you even make the connection?
Smh I hate when American debunk anime logic. You just don’t.
Applying real world physics to psychic energy which doesn't exist in the real world....ok
The music you put in your videos scare me
50hrs of gameplay per game? haha, no
I am a simple man.\nI see a reference to Hitchhiker guide to the galaxy, I upvote
Don't you think that the ONE AND ONLY EXAMPLE you put forward speaks more towards its psychic strength rather than the black holes it self? After all being able to compress matter with only the power of your mind, much like your jokes and over all humor, is no laughing matter.
Should of looked at Macargo the lava snail or regice the really really cold.
The definition said nothing about needing matter, just a gravimetric force.
It could always crush the threat into a tiny black hole
Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell: What if there was a black hole in your pocket?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ\n\nA micro black hole with the mass of a coin, would evaporate in an explosion comparable to a nuclear bomb.
If you're going to say that the first law of thermodynamics applies to Pokémon, you're gonna have a bad time. The Pokémon universe is clearly one that fundamental physics doesn't apply in.
I really hate your voice........
How is this title not clickbait?
I don't see the lie here?\nthere is obviously a middle ground it's not either the moon or a micro pebble\nfirst you need to Quantify the weight of that Pokemons average Psychic power as that is the units that are being expended here\nin order to do that Mattpat needs to go all death battle with the pokemon in question and i'm uncertain that the information is readily available in universe
MATPAT ALL OF YOUR POKEMON THEORIES SUCK GIANT GREAT BALLS!! PLEASE STOP MAKING POKEMOM BASED VIDEOS
I like your death note reference
i was hoping for it to be more about the pokedex and more pokemon, not 1 pokemon :(
1:23 ...the Pokedex, this pocket encyclopedia... I'm gonna' have to stop you there, MatPat. It's not an encyclopedia at all! If it were, it would be called the Pokepedia! Instead, it's a PokeDEX. Why? Because it's a Pokemon index! Indexes are informal collections of information designed to give a general knowledge of a given subject. Thing is? An index isn't held up to anywhere near as high a standard as an encyclopedia. If the author of the index chooses to do proper research and find the real truth about things, all the better, but it is nowhere near required. Which is why some 'dex entries for Exeggcute claim it to be a cluster of eggs, while others say it is merely MISTAKEN for eggs frequently, when the truth is they're more like seeds. Mistakes like the former are acceptable in an index.
Wait... if black holes produce radiation,  if radiation has mass... wouldn't it be pulled back into the black hole
The concept of black hole radiation contradicts the concept of black holes themselves. Enough gravity that light cannot escape. No mass can escape that gravitational pull, therefore radiation from a black hole is absolutely impossible. It's a logical impossibility for both of those concepts to be true.
something my friend explained to me, all of the entries in the poke'dex could just be nothing more than folklore, not an actuality. in the universe of pokemon, the pokemon themselves have been around a lot longer than the dex and considering these creatures are magical, there's a good chance the characters would have stories and legends about the them. sure the professors were the ones to have made the dex, however they themselves never once say they saw these creatures doing some of these really creepy things, and if they did, they're monsters especially in the case of Driftloon
Do giratina (it would probably be interesting) 😉😉
Victini's infinite energy that its Pokédex entries reference cannot actually be infinite. How can you actually fit an infinite energy source into a body with finite volume, let alone one about the size (and indeed, mass) of a Pikachu? Even taking into account the famous Einstein equation E = m*c^2, you would get a whole bunch of potential energy, so certainly enough to make the Tepig's attack overkill even against a Pokémon against which it has a type disadvantage (which I at least think is Samurott), but it's still a finite figure.
Ya know MatPat you say black holes are really dense. You're right. I did this as a science project at school. Black holes are INFINITELY dense!
Can you please analyse Deoxys? In the Pokedex is written something about a Virus.
I love all the references in this video, especially gmm and the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy reference
Matpat, you need to up your Hawking game :). Ultra small black holes are extremely deadly as they convert their entire mass into energy crazy fast.  A 5gram black hole would create a bigger blast than a nuke... many nukes in fact.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8nHBGFKLHZQ\n\nYou can also create black holes without needing great amounts of mass, check out a kugleblitz, basically a black hole created with extreme amounts of light.
You do a debunk on Blastoise and the Cannons on it's back

... what if the big issue is the Pokedex isn't written by the Professors, but by the 10 year old trainers that they are given too... that is part of your job in the first pokemon game, fill the Pokedex...
Black holes ARE NOT invisible. For something to be invisible light must freely pass through it. You would see a blackhole. When you walk into a pitch black room you don't call everything in the dark room invisible.... you call it dark.... like you can't see anything because your eyes are unable to spot light.... Seeing a blackhole would be the same. Not to mention the light bending around the blackhole would be insanely bright. Quasars and blazars are some of the brightest things in our universe.
Guys every video thumbnail on this channel with the game theory logo has matpat in it!
I think that even if those mini black holes that Gardevoir creates, evaporates quickly, they last long enough to protect their trainers from certain projectiles
Let me stop you there at 1:57 you're already wrong it's not a main source of information in the games manga and anime pokedex's are rare and only handed to certain people only the protagonist has one in each. Youngster Joey doesn't have a pokedex. None of the champions even refer to a pokedex except Cynthia
Whether you believe in the validity of IQ ratings or not, I've always questioned the servitude of an Alakazam and it's intelligence quotient of over 5000 (which has nothing on black holes or ability to distort time and space OR....)
You didn't say that Gardevoir's spike thing will impale u if u hug it
this is the pokemon world, where physics is different than what we know.
1) How comes he didn't mention the rule 34?\n\n2) Darumaka. Do Darumaka next.
Renucleus. Just analyse if it is possible to exist.
The real question is how is trubbish alive it literally is a bag of rubbish
Why is this stupid idiot talking about black holes for a Pokemon video so stupid talk about running out of content
What if gardavoir extually uses its psychic abilitys to hold it stable and in place
Quick note: The professors don't do their own research. The children they gives pokedexes to so the research.
Gen 3 for Pokémon go confirmed
This is just one of the many pokedex entries you could say the same thing about XD
The eeveelutions if that's haw u spell it 😃
Came to hear about the multiple lies in the Dex.\n\n\n\nGot a fifteen minute lesson about black holes and one pokemon lol.
How do z-moves and/or mega evolution work
Where is my doctor who part 3 matpat
let's be honest we all know why he covered gardevoir
I would love to see you make a Theory about Warframe's lore.
He does know that the pokemon can use psychic ability doesn't he ?
I already knew this as fact. Time for the extra dark detail about it!\n\n\n\n\nBut accually tho luv ur content
Im sorry but this is not a hate comment but this isnt eveb about the pokedex its about blackholes....
I read the black hole because I used the pause button😐 derp 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
also Gardevoir can freaking eat your dreams, so I bet it could use that power to at least pull up 2 chunks of the earth, squish them together, and create a black hole lasting at least a couple seconds, using it to protect it's trainer!
rhyhorn, how its bones are 1000x harder than human bones
Sorry MatPat. Austin already does The Science!
There are pokemon like yamask who apparently where at one point humans according to the pokedex but this has some holes like how are there human ghosts if they become pokemon when they die?and how do they even know that these pokemon were humans?
But matpat, that's just one pokemon,  not all pokemon can have wrong information on them, right?
Before watching this theory, here is my theory that I really believed for a long time. In the Pokemon games, the pokedex entry that you gain after catching a new pokemon is so inaccurate, it could only be written by a certain 10 year old. I believe that the entries are written by the player on the spot without any prior research. This explains the stupid descriptions like Charmander's tail and the terrible measurements. Wailord's weight per volume puts him as being as dense as hot air balloon.
How does a squirtle- Blastoise hold so much water in them? Can someone explain?
Here is voice acting for the intro!!   Destroyed all of your child hood fnaf was made up of dead children,solved everything in gaming,and was mostly right!!!!da da da!!!😆
You just debunked your Antman can destroy the world theory.
In theory , f=m(g)/r^2. So so even if you squeeze 2 atoms together to a point where it is small enough that it can collapse on its own gravity , Ta-da , mini backhole. \n Also note that hawking radiation is caused by vacuum fluctuations.  \nNote 2, note that is failed to maintain its gravity to stay together , release energy \nE=mc^2 lama
But you ignored the whole it uses psychic energy to create the black hole it, out right stated the creation technique which can be interpreted to mean that it uses its psychic energy to condense the mass but it could also mean that it creates one out of pure psychic energy which would be a completely different entity then a black hole but may be explained best by using a black hole as an example. Also I think it should be acknowledged that true psychic abilities are not necessarily covered by science so its hard to say what rules of the physical world it obeys and follows gardevoir may create a true black hole of mass but through psychic energy be able to ignore its gravity and manipulate how the force acts on its environment like how we are able to direct a vacuum cleaner it may be a tool she can use.\n\nJust curious about your thoughts on this? Still love the show though.
Hello Matt, I know you often read the comments on your videos, and I really hope you read this one too. This is my first comment ever, and the reason I chose to make this my first comment is because of the videos you made on fake news. They changed my perception on the world and helped me realize that things aren't always as they seem. I'm new to your channels, but since I discovered them I've pretty much marathoned 'em. What I'm trying to say is that you're content is great, and I hope you continue to open peoples eyes. Good luck and God speed.
4:22 Me: You missed an opportunity to make an Interstellar reference 10 seconds later Yyeeeeessss
If black holes absorb light, how are you reading this? - lol nice one (10:22)
But what if Gardevoir makes the opponent into a black hole?
I know that this one video is just covering what the description but... gardevoir (in the anime since a player can choose different moves) normally has shadow ball. so its probably referring to that in a tall tale.
arceus coming out of an egg and then being king of pokemon
Yes but assuming Gardevoir's telekinetic powers are formidable enough, wouldn't it be possible for it to create a black hole within its opponent? My logic is that even though this black hole would last at most 10^-27 seconds, it could still do lots of damage within a body instead of a vacuum like in the particle accelerator.
The pokedex is still in Beta, \nevery game the professor mentions that you and a few more trainers are trialing it. \nThat's why it's your job is to complete the pokedex.
Did mat pat straight up call the 10 commandments bull
wait what ? Black holes produce heat ? ludicrous, where do you get your info really ?
hey matpat can you make another video on fnaf or bendy and the ink machine ?
Please do the Jesus Pokemon, pleaseeeeee or dialga, idk one of the Legendary Pokemons and I'll be Satisfied 150% still i'll  be pleased mat （＾ω＾）
Gotta give points on that Hitchhikers reference game theory.
There should be a theory of krabby actually being a mantis shrimp and not a crab since mantis shrimps create cavitation bubbles which have a strong similarity to in the cartoon where krabby signature attack is bubble beam
You're making a big deal out of this.
I think a better much more accepted theory about the pokedex's inaccuracy is that it's written by 10 year olds. The plot of the games is you collect data on pokemon via your pokedex which then fills itself out. If you look at some of the entries they obviously seem written by a child. Check Alakazam for a good example.
Something on how arceus is the god of Pokemon despite mew being the first Pokemon would be awesome.
it could just make the black hole out of the danger so yah
Soooo.... what I'm gathering is that Thor's hammer is heavier... than a microscopic black hole with the mass of a moon? Tbh I have no honest why I thought of that. I'm stupid. If you had my twelve year old mind, you're understand.
Imagine if Wikipedia was full of lies.\n\n\n\n\n\nLol
You should do how deadly would it be to fall off rainbow road
Please do the fake pikachu one that would be great!
torterra ! hey mat pat how does it have a tree at its back. like so as he could see
Dear matpat, Just a quick question, with fnaf4 is it possible the stuffed toys we see disappear at the end of the game are in the box at the end of the game we cant open, if you think about it, it kinda makes sense but i dont know if this has already been covered already, please like this so Matpat can see because i really want to see this covered
Here's a Pokemon MatPat could do: Magcargo. Mainly because of it's Pokemon Sapphire entry: Magcargo's body temperature is approximately 18,000 degrees F. Water is vaporized on contact. If this Pokémon is caught in the rain, the raindrops instantly turn into steam, cloaking the area in a thick fog.
Bulbasaur, please, I want to make sure my favorite Pokemon is perfect. Please.
Your eyes perceive little to no light as black, so by not seeing anything  you are seeing black. It's like saying that you are seeing nothing, so it's not nothing, it is invisible.
Maybe her psychic powers can make that the black hole not emit radiation

Matpat analyse mimikyu
Maybe they meant to say that it can manipulate gravity around it rather than creating a black hole. It would make more sense that way since there are pokemon and moves that deal with manipulating gravitational pull on themselves and their opponents
Gardevoir could just compress the object/creature imposing danger on its trainer into a blackhole, which would be too small and immediately fizzle into the air as hawking radiation.
Yeah okay, the black hole thing is incredibly silly, but the amount of Rule 34 on that thing is absurd!!\n(Semi-)Joking aside, I'll never understand pokemon titles. Like Gardevoir being the Embrace pokemon when [a] no dex entry ever really explains that, and [b] it has that spiky-heart-crystal-doodad on its chest. I always assumed it would have to be soft, like fleshy, otherwise... well the internet is full of embrace jokes.\nAnother one that leaps to mind is Arcanine being the Legendary pokemon. What makes big-ol' hellhound legendary?
I got that hitchhikers guide to the galaxy reference with the wale and flower
But what if a cubic metre of air (mass ~1.3kg) was condensed into a black hole in the centre of an attack. It would have a lifetime of 1.8*10^-16 seconds, but could surely disrupt the attack velocity, energy, etc. If not, the movement of air would also affect the attack, disrupting it in some way. If it compressed 10 cubic metres of air, the black hole would have a lifetime of 1.8*1^-13 s and even more mass to disrupt the attack. This also isn't considering the heat that would be generated by compressing so much mass so quickly. My point in this argument is that the black hole does not need to be stable to affect the environment and if the description was accurate it would be beneficial not to have a stable black hole as that would destroy the earth as stated. Also there is plenty of mass lying around that could be used, and wouldn't be noticed missing. Although it takes tremendous energy to compress matter past its neutron degeneracy pressure, is there an accurate or reliable scale or description of what psychic powers are? Idk, I thought of this argument and found a calculator online.
The fun of this was soaked by a black hole
But what if Gardevoir used its powers to condense the threat/enemy into a black hole? That would turn out okay, because the black hole would be unstable and simply evaporate, rather than destroying the world.
Please can you do Pikachu?
Two actual Pokedex facts:\nMagcargo. It's literally hotter than the sun.\nAlso one day a kid woke up as a Kadabra. Sounds legit.
And yes they do evaporate extremely quickly but what if you make to many of them ir may be by minute amounts it still takes bacteria and matter of all sorts... all the numbers will add up to a big number.... please think about what your talking about scientists. Dont destroy your own planet.
Have you heard of whats called different universes?
I can't stand these black hole analogies. They're so bad \nI hope he ends up mentioning micro black holes that you can create from two particles mashing into each other which then evaporate to hawking radiation. \nI dunno how a pokemon would want to deal a neither world destroying attack nor an attack that is too small to even notice. There is no black hole size where this would be the case. \nSo yeah Matt you did it. You called BS on pokemon physics. Good job
well he just ruined my favorite pokemon, thanks matpat XD. seriously tho keep up the good work :)
Mat, the FNAF timeline is messed up, cuz the phone guy in the second says there's no doors this time even though the time era is BEFORE FNAF 1. To be honest the whole damn TIMELINE is messed up. Please theory this, or tell me at me Twitter @DukeTheNuke2.
I think wailord would do for a good exposing
11:07 MAT BILL NYE ISN'T A REAL SCIENTIST OMG!!!
Do Rayquaza and how it gets the energy to mega evolve despite not having a trainer and also, how it somehow consumes meteors for energy?
13:19 fun fact as black holes gain mass their density drops
So what if instead of using mass, psychic abilities alone are used to distort the fabric of space (which is from my understanding, those distortions cause gravity) and this distortion causes the same effects as a black hole without the need of any mass? Really would appreachiate feedback here though!
Matpat please do a theory about gravity falls series, it has a lot of mystery to unlock for you <3
A microscopic black hole is what is needed to leap in time in the time drama anime steins gate,maybe the microscopic black hole is used to reverse time although that kills gardevoir in the process since she has to maintain a the black hole for long enough .
Maybe MatPat should do a theory about mega evolution or z-moves or maybe even both like which is superior!
But here is the thing... it's a game.. their black holes don't follow the laws of physics.. \n\nThat said... yah, a lot of stuff in the Dex are just legends and myths added in... and it's more for us players than for the characters.
Didn't Austin already cover this?
When he was talking about black holes, anyone jump to make sure they still had our gravity? 😂
What you forget is that when a black hole completely evaporates it releases a tremendous amount of energy. If a black hole with the mass of a penny were to completely evaporate, it would cause an explosion larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. So, if gardevoir were to create mini black holes she could attack opponents with controlled explosions.
Gardevoir has telekinetic powers. Expending all of its energy, it uses this power to SUSTAIN a black hole. Telekinesis is one of those abilities that is more powerful the better the user understands what they're doing. The Gardevoir knows what it's doing. It's pulling matter from all around it into the black hole, thus sustaining it artificially in a way that natural black holes simply cannot do themselves.\nYour science is right, but your understanding of the game is lacking in this case. A little bit disappointing.
Matpat!! Please do a theory on Duck Season, the VR game. It's mysterious and would be a great episode! Like if you agree and so Matpat can see.
Yes but magic and stuff
wouldnt it still be considered a small blackhole if they compressed the thing that was trying to hurt their trainer? and the attacker would be radiation that would probably stop being radiated and become part of earth again.... and it does say to protect them meaning they might only use this as a last hope type thing as creating blackholes and bypassing the effects of gravity (it does say they dont feel gravity but doesnt mean it wont affect them) they would probably be able to detect human emotion.... and hopefully the emotion of the things that it might need to destroy so it feels bad but....
you don't even need to go that far to prove it wrong: creating a black hole large enough to fit a human would fail at protecting it since said trainer would just get crushed by the presure
Make a video about Entei and if his roars, or a loud enough sound, could make volcanoes erupt.
if there’s is anything about Empoleon , maybe it then ?
I really appreciate the 8-bit horror music.
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Professors in the Pokémon world are dicks.
Isn't the Color black also known as the lack of color, and because a black hole has no light (thus meaning no color) work for a name? Like symbolism or something?
Aren't you overlooking the fact that they can teleport?\n\nWhy bother doing anything with particles to make a black hole when they could potentially just recreate similar spatial distortion withe their phenomenal cosmic mind powers?
your wrong, after the small black hole evaporates it creates an explosion powerful enough to destroy earth.
But Pokémon has no physics\n\n\n\n\n\nU can capture god but can’t burn a tree
Black holes aren't invisible. That's not what invisible means. Or black.\n\nA black hole absorbs all light that crosses it's event horizon. Leaving aside that they arr frequently surrounded by orbiting matter, a more critical point is... They block light!\nThus, if a black hole were to pass in front of something, you would be unable to see through the black hole to the objects behind it.\nThis makes it... Black.\nBlack being the abbsence of colour, or in theory, the absense of visible light.\nPaint cannot ever truly absorb ALL light, but note that the whole point of an object being black as opposed to grey or white is  that it neithrr reflects nor emits large amounts of light. Thus, the less light an object is capable of emitting or reflecting, the closer it is to being truly 'black'.\nFor an object to be invisible however, it has to not be detectable.\nBut a black object held in front of a bright, coloured background is very visible indeed.\nWhat is NOT so visible, is a transparent object, such as glass.\nThus an invisible object would not be one that absorbs or reflects light, but one which transmits it without ever absorbing or distorting any of it.\nNone of which describes a black hole.\nThus, a black hole is indeed black, and not invisible. What renders black holes invisible is trying to look at one against a background with little to no contrast.
But anything can become a black hole just neutron stars is heavy enough to make one about every time earth into a peanut would make a black hole so... aye that's pretty neat
Plz do one about our lord and savior Arceus and the ones more close to him.
Do a game theory on ROBLOX!
10:23 I don’t know
I refuse to accept that the Pokedex entries aren't ALL true ALL the time.
i like the ksp music, noice
Do Arceus THE GOD OF ALL POKEMON
Can Yveltal actually absorb all life on earth if it dies? Is that actually possible?
You have to pay after 2 samples, I would know. \n\nPs. Yandere waifu.
Gardevoir makes a sphere of intense artificial gravity, simulating a black hole.
do alakazam.\nhis pokedex entry.\njust that.\n(about the little kid)
I can read it cuz I'm magic
I feel like Matt really just wanted to make a video about black holes
*radiation has energy which can be converted into mass\nRadiation itself doesn't have mass.
What if Gardevoir would keep on shooting subatomic particles before it disintegrates?
one problem, The move moon blast....
You lost me at conservation of matter.
ok 1 i am at 2:22 right now but as we know research and facts can be debunked as new evedence is presented. Things can be thought right and never re evaluated through time as we have seen in history before... that is until someone actually dose look at it more in depth. The Pokedex is rewriten almost every game meaning new information in the pokemon world is found also meaning they know that this process exists and that the knolage on pokemon would be in a grey area untill a set time that they have cold hard facts figured out which could take many many years. also... blub blub
Where is part 2 of indoctrination theory
Wait! One Pokémon?! The Pokedex tells us Lies about ONE Pokémon and you say its full of it!!\nSorry. Nice Episode, but the Title was a bit misleading.
Um... If that is actually how a black hole works (I've followed up on this part of your theory and even theoretical scientist can't really confirm that is actually how a black hole works), wouldn't the black holes sucking in all the light actually make it black not invisible. Or rather we perceive it as black because everything around it is  bouncing off light and in contrast to that it makes the hole actually look black? If it were invisible we would see through it and in order to see through it but still be there it has to refract some sort of light doesn't it?
Gardevoir just turns the enemy pokemon into a black hole, but good game MattPat.
Black is the absence of light.
Can you do a theory on call of duty zombies storyline
Shadowball looks like a black hole, but obviously isn't because video game logic. Fake news.
Honestly I learned so much about black holes I forgot this episode was about pokemon.
what if gardevoir creates the black hole then hugs its trainer so they wouldnt get sucked in?
Can you do a game theory on Ruby Quest? It's a creepy click and point adventure game found on http://evilcorporation.com.br/rubyquest/ and while it seems like there's a pretty easy meaning to find due to it being connected to the poem The Metal Glen by Willam Murdoch, I'm pretty sure you could find something more than worthwhile.

10:22 i dont know
Maybe analyze Gallade next?
Here's the thing - if Gardevoir can manipulate singular particals, couldn't it just seriously mess with an object, or person, nearby?\nAs in kill 'em ded, no blackholes required
Analyse Magneton, aside from the fact that their non-biological what kind of magnetism keeps them stuck together? Cuase whatever it is it ain't ferromagnetism as their not pulling in everything that ferromagnetic around them 24/7.
golbat is interesting to me can you please try it
*comments about the next dr who theory*
Loved the Good Mythical Morning reference!
10:22, because its 4 O'Clock and im still on my computer and the light of it is bouncing off it
Ok let me explain something the pokedex is an online encyclopaedia you use in the pokemon manga pokemon adventures at the very moment red gets his pokedex oak says  i want you to find all the pokemon and write down everything you learn about them  on to the pokemon encyclopaedia so then ethier you the trainer finds a legendry and write down what they learn about them and if someone found it before them they can lie but you the trainer can fix it you're welcome.
I would love to hear about mew two and the genetics behind him (since he was created and all that jazz).
How about Magikarp or Alakazam or Magcargo? Or Tyranitar, Charmander getting surfed by water and still not dying from no tail fire
I'm gonna have to call bs. Radiation is light, right? Then how could it actually escape a black hole? I'm personally convinced by the idea that it gives off radiation is nothing more than light slingshot off the black hole's gravity like most science fiction. Otherwise, there are actual particles that are not affected by gravity to any extent.\n\nGuess which one seems more likely, but who am I to reasonably question science.
Is there a reason why Earth physics work for the Poké-verse? It didn't in the Assassin's Creed world! [Leap of Faith - video]. \nAlso can anyone tell me if FilmTheory has created a theory based on the Big Hero 6 portals?
matpat plz do mimikyu or type null I'm so intrigued\ni mainly want to see type null
Oh, who knows creating a black hole as an attack is not possible, so I guess a Squirtle squirting out water obviously way more than its body size is complete fine then? Or basically all psychic attacks, totally scientifically possible, eh?
which POKEMON to analyze next? More like next POKEMON to destroy...
I like how he shows eggman running faster than sonic in the intro
Bad science. This channel's theory, not the Pokedex. Completely lacks understanding of singularities. First, the minimum size and energy of small black hole are not certain. Secondly, assuming the rate of Hawking radiation is as predicted a 70 metric ton blackhole would be stable for about a year, 20 metric tons about a second. Something the mass of the moon would basically last longer than the current age of the universe. Now a micro-singularity weighing about 20 metric tons would still be lethal if not due to gravity due to the radiation released we are talking 389,740 megatonnes of TNT worth of energy in a second. The radiation would definitely kill you and probably everything on the planet. A black hole with the energy of a kilogram of TNT would have a mass of like 0.05 micrograms and only need to last a fraction of a second and could still harm any threat to its trainer. The question would be how the hell does it shield its trainer from the radiation. Also, black holes aren't invisible more like if you could actually see it it would be black since black is the absence of light. Now due to gravity bending light, it would kind of be like a lens bending light around it but I am too lazy to work out the math right now. The reason we can't directly see black holes in space is not because they are invisible but because the accretion disk is basically generating massive amounts of radiation mostly in the form of x-rays and the blackhole itself doesn't directly emit light and absorbs the light headed toward it so there is no way to see it since the empty space also doesn't directly emit light. basically a black body against a mostly black background would be invisible.  But I imagine like a marble on a tablecloth if space had way more stars and empty space was not black these black holes would not be invisible. Meaning if an entity ever made one on a planet it could be visible and probably larger than expected since while the sigularity would be microscoping the well creating the lensing could be significantly larger.
Okay, first off,\nDon't question Pokémon. Anything's possible in the world of Nintendo.\nAnd second,\nIt's actually Shadow Ball. Oh well, whatever.\nAlso, I want myself analyzed, please.
I want to see why wormadons (i think i spelled it wrong)can stick in branches,and what insect does it convey as?
Hey can we get a bloodborne theory?
Do Snorlax please! Weighing up to 1000lbs, needing to eat 900lbs of food EVERY DAY!
Snorlax is gonna kill us all ... right?
new theory\n\ngardevoir is an evil psychopath bent on the destruction of the entire earth. or maybe it does this to save the universe by stopping Mewtwo. just a thought.
Wouldn't you be able to see the black hole because of the things that are far behind the black hole?
Can you plz do a theory on pikmin
I hate this the black holes would immidately die bai hawking radation.

Kinda dont wana ruin ur rant but did u watch the first episode of pokemon? The pokedex is a prototype that is wrong and very incomplete , there are several pokemon just not in it, and Ash receives it to help complete it , and spoiler ash is an idiot that fights rock pokemon with a pikachu.... Just saying Ash doesnt know what a blackhole is....
The issue is that (according to the Pokedex) Gardevoir uses psychokinetic power to distort dimensions in Sapphire, and psychic power in Black/White. So we know that some kind of psychic power is at play, which deals with the realm of nonexistent forces and magic. If that is the case, then the creation and utility of black holes is possible the moment magic is allowed in the context. Magic can be used to justify any questionable claim. How doesn't the world get destroyed when Gardevoir uses makes a black hole? Magic. Why don't pokemon die when they are hit with extremely powerful attacks? Magic. The mention that Gardevoir is not affected by gravity should have already notified you about the involvement of magic. In our understanding of the universe, nothing is unaffected by gravity. Then what is Gardevoir made of? Perhaps magic? \n\nAlso, your claim that science is lying to us with the term 'black holes' is misleading at best. Yes, the term may be inaccurate for its description, but it is not a lie to have a misleading term. Black holes are a shorthand way to describe these things in space; it's a name. \n\nOh, and the title of the video? FULL OF LIES, you say? You have only made a (questionable) claim about one pokemon's pokedex entry. One out of several hundred pokedex entries is not sufficient to make a FULL OF LIES claim. Perhaps a more accurate clickbait title would be Game Theory: The Pokedex LIES TO US. That title is in line with your claim, which I believe is incorrect anyway. \n\nFeel free to discuss and point out any errors in my thinking. I am happy to admit my wrongs. \n\nTL;DR: \nGardevoir uses psychic power, which is essentially magic. Magic can justify anything, including the use of black holes.
seems like this should've been an Austin episode...
Larvitar and the fact that it eats mountains, maybe?
technically since black holes suck in light you would notice a growing darkness near one as the light is removed forming a shadow, which also means looking away from a black hole would be brighter than looking at one (as looking away from one you would observe the light getting sucked into the blackhole and as a result, in your direction). think of it as a light that emits darkness
please I want to see salamance
Matpat can repeat the same statement so many times in one video that a small black hole will form and suck all my interest away.
Here's a Fire Emblem theory: The Weapon Triangle (Swords beats Axes, Axes beats Lances, Lances beat Swords): Can that it work in real life?

Too nerdy for Game Theory? Ha! NOTHING IS TOO NERDY FOR GAME THEORY!!!
make a threoy about how greninja lost to charizrad
man i love me some POKEYMANS!!!!
I like the little subtleties of these videos of his, like when he said black holes suck in the light an image of Light Yagami from death note went into it.
it's pokemon, who's to say that it is the same world where physics are the same? in the pokemon universe we have creatures that tear time and space, that create worlds,  that can travel travel between universes. you look too deep into a world that could be completely different, for someone who uses the multiverse theory often, you should take this into consideration.
Next time you talk about black holes can you slip in the word Spaghettification ?\nNot sure if I spelled it right but it's supposed to be a homogeneous gravitational field caused by extreme tidal forces, in the most extreme cases, near black holes,the stretching is so powerful that no object can withstand it, no matter how strong its components. Within a small region the horizontal compression balances the vertical stretching so that small objects being spaghettified experience no net change in volume.\nWell it says so in Wikipedia.
can someone just tell pat. its just a game ;'))))))))))))))))))))).
Wikipedia is full of alot of lies don't trust it it can be edited by anyone. 0-0
And then you realize that one of gardevoir's attacks is Moonblast..... throwing a black hole at a pokemon?
Does that mean that Rick in Rick and Morty's portal gun has something to do with black holes? Maybe you could do a theory on that, idk.
Um, the pokedex never states that the black holes are SUCCESSFUL in protecting their trainer. And by the way something that is truly black is literally invisible. Black = the absence of light. There is no such thing as black light.
This video is dumb... like... really dumb... dumb enough for me to think about unsubscribing. Also this video is really padded out which could be 1/2 the time.
Mew; Genesis Supernova, Mewtwo: part human, Blaine is the dad where ditto used to be in the DNA
I think Gardevoir uses their psychic powers to make the small black hole stable
what if gardevoir protect her trainers from them self\nyou know\nhuman cant be trusted with their nature?\nlmew
How is Gardevoir the embrace pokemon? She has a freaking blade coming out her chest!
Also tiny black holes explode with light, so they could be used as a weapon.
If black holes absorb light, how are you reading this?
yes a pokemon video. ps flying types are the best.
Isn't pure black an ABSENSE of light?\n\nAlso, the pokedex RECORDS information AUTOMATICALLY, meaning it's not directly written by the professors.
14:36 that picture is my screensaver!!!!!
This was a cool episode because I was fascinated by black holes and wonder if mega Man 9 black hole bomb would work\n\nCan you please do an episode on the regi trio their Pokedex says their industuctable and is it even possible for ice metal and rock to be so
Wait if we can't see a black hole and they accidentally made one and thier just playing POKEMON GO that means..... We die? And wait how do we disable it or destroy it oh wait we can't destroy..... Wow i hate scientists......
i know im breaking the sixth commanmet but where is the 3rd doctor who?
6:40    Is it just me or does that background music sound like Kerbal Space Program?\n\n\nEdit:\nNo its not just me, went further into the vid, MAOR Kerbal Space Program music.
I love the ksp music
Sometimes we get things wrong on this channel.\n\nA way to reduce this is to play the game first before toughing it. Like TF2, or from what I heard, Undertale when you did the ness is Sans... I still don't see it.\n\nAlso, what's the tech of the Pokemon universe? I assume it's the same as ours but they use Pokeballs that can contain things muuuuuch larger than the ball itself, which can compress... What's to stop the gardevoire from keeping the Black hole contained? and wouldn't a Shadow ball look like a Black Hole? It certainly looks like a void. Everyone knows what a shadow ball looks like but the question becomes, what happens if it's altered slightly. If your creating it with mental powers then you can limit the mass going into it and also pull things into it. Say the thing that's trying to kill the trainer.\n\nPokemon's weird and with physics different than our own, it's going to be tough to judge
i LOVE this into

Remember Steam users, please!
I hear Spielberg is in talks to direct the 3rd season opener. Really hope he does it. Would be a [literal] return to his 80s roots.
I love how this is trending with only 80k views.

I need this in my life.
Its hard to search for it in the play store. I downloaded it after clicking links that directed me to it in the store. Uninstalled it because im werry of its access.
LOL this trailer just spoiled me a lot, I just started watching
Looks great! But please...pretty please. Bring it to the Nintendo Switch?
I need this to happen
To everyone asking, the game is an app, available on iOS and Android.
Is this gonna be a real game?
If they make a stranger things game, I don’t want it to follow the shows plot. I’d want it to be a completely original story.\n\nedit:unless this already is an original story
Lol wat I have more subs than this company:0
this looks just like Zelda!
I almost blew up my hand playing with dry ice.
Here before this blows up, it's only a matter of time. This looks awesome, but please, please, PLEASE don't make a bad game adaptation! We all want to see a good quality game and not something rushed and thrown together just to earn some quick money.
Omg want.\nDoesn't it come out Halloween?
I'm here before this blows up. I made an it parody check it out ❤️
I wish they'd do a Stranger Things TellTale game instead
I want a stranger things game similar to Friday the 13
where can I find it and bring it to the Nintendo switch
Please be real.

LMAO.. So, it's pretty much like the bible, of all things!!
I'm conflicted. On one hand I wanna see an arcanine episode, since he's my favorite, but I don't wanna have him ruined for me...
A random thought... If Ditto has a set mass(mass can't be created), his weight shouldn't be able to change when he takes the form of a larger Pokemon, then a plain Ditto should have the same weight and mass as a Ditto that takes the form of a Snorelax. \n\nNow Here's a question! How large of a pokemon or object would Ditto have to transform into, until his density, is less than the air around him, and he begins to float? \n\nPlease upvote, I'm curious about this one...
Pretty sure every Poke-tuber on Youtube has done at least one video covering this exact subject matter.
15 mins on black holes and y a Pokémon can't make one.
How about the Pokédex entry for Magcargo? It claims that it is 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit which would make it literally impossible for normal humans to even get near the thing without immediately frying to death. Also, the entries aren't written by the professors. They, instead, have children go out and collect their data for them which seems extremely unprofessional and thus, could lead to tons of misinformation within the dex. Misinformation that, as far as we know, the professors never bother to check and fix.
Legit \nHello everybody want to get free stuff download Verydice and start rolling use my code 1177158
Hey matpat, MATPAT! STAT! So we have the pokedex, right? And we, a ten year old kid are filling it out, NOT the professors so basically we're writing the entry's therefore making things up because, say we see a gardevoir use shadow ball and immediately think it's a black hole?
Magearna plase...realy: How da heal does that thing moves?!?!?
Honestly would love to see Eevees or hell maybe one of the alolan pokemon?
What if pokemon is magic and they is no science to it.\nWhat if pokemon have inner power that can create and control energy.
My one point of contention with your reasoning on this MatPat is that you assume the black hole has to be stable. More than likely the black holes it would use as attacks are meant to strike quickly, (most likely within a fraction of a second, since while they're turn based in game, Pokemon battles are generally shown to be relatively fast paced in the show), before dissipating. This would allow it to attack and deal severe damage to its opponent, without going to the incredibly ridiculous lengths necessary to create a stable black hole. Not saying your information about black holes or your research is incorrect, but rather that you're not considering the practical application of how it would attack with said black holes. Still a good episode over all, and I'm looking forward to more as there are a lot of entries that make little sense, but I did have to point out my personal disagreement with your over all conclusion on this one......
HAHAHAHA I just noticed you are using the Kerbal Space Program soundtrack! Nice choice for a space episode!
Wouldnt its hug kill you via the massive red spike on its chest
Matpat: the Pokedex is full of lies\nme: click\nMatpat: just 1 example
Black holes are product of scientists imagination.
5:30  “Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.”
Your setting yourself up for failure in another video. Then you won't have the pokedex to lean on for backup evidence
Soundtrack sponsored by kerbal space program. Is there a game theory on that coming?
Moltres like how does the fire stay alight when moltres is flying super fast
heres the first thing. Pokemon is fictional, it doesnt always need to follow every real life law of physics
Or maybe gardeviour creates something that can suck in stuff, but isn't a black hole, and they just call it a black hole.
Be nice to my creepy Wisp Monster, MatPat! She's sensitive...\n\nAnyways, what about Swampert? Towing yachts at jet ski speeds seems a bit far fetched for the guy, right?
came for the pokemon, stayed for the science.
Matty Patty you're forgetting one very important thing. The pokedex isn't written by the professors, but by the 10 year olds they give them to. That's why if your character only sees a Pokemon but doesn't catch it only the picture and some very limited (basically nothing) information is added. Its only when the trainer catches the Pokemon that the entry is filled out. Its not lies, but the limited knowledge (see myths and lore) and over active imagination of a 10 year old trainer. I'm disappointed in you Pattycakes, you're better than this.
Who came first: Arceus or Mew?
But i cant read D:\n\nIf you are wonderong, lies means read that in german.\n\nOh and btw, no one is mentioning that Mat is doing   scientific theorys again?
I think the keywords are psychic power. Maybe it's psychic power are dense enough to create a black hole. Don't forget it's a while different universe so not everything is the same as it is in ours.
Wait the dex is filled by the trainers so perhaps that pokemon is just using shadow ball or dark big bang attack and the trainer being just a kid doesn't know any better.
Trust me, grab nearly ANY ghost type Pokemon and you have one creeypasta filled episode. Like Yamask (It's mask is it's former human face.) or even Phantump (The soul of a child that died in the woods and then possessed a tree.).
10:21 if black holes absorb light how are you reading this
Can you do a theory on doraemon especially of bamboo copter and anywhere door
4:00 there is no such thing as black light bouncing into your eye. Black is the absence of color, where a material partially absorbs light. It just so happens that black holes absorb all light. If black holes were invisible, we'd be able to see straight through them.
The catch is that It was admitted that black holes don't actually exist, given that any amount of matter smashed into such a small space would begin to rotate, and the smaller it got, the faster it would rotate, until the kinetic force of the spin was pushing just as hard as the gravity was pulling, causing it to simply rotate infinitely. Therefore, black holes don't actually exist. At best they make certain mathematical problems possible, but that's about it.
uhhh question: what if gardevoir could compress the mass of something small (similar mass to a bullet) inside the danger whatever it may be?\nsure it would quickly evaporate but in the fraction of a second that it would exist it could burn the danger away (altough I know nothing about black holes so maybe I'm wrong)\nor I don't know... gardevoir could compress THE DANGER ITSELF! once again it would evaporate, but that would work in the trainner's favor would it not?
The moon could NOT become a stable Black Hole.\nTo become a Black Hole and stay stable you need 2 things:\nMass (around 150x our sun)\nAnd a supernova that crushes that mass into a space as tiny as a tennisball. \nYou cant create a black Hole that can stay alive out of sth as small as the moon or 20x our sun my friend :P
Can you do a book theory of the Jedi order book series the yusa vong Wars please it’s a Star Wars book please
So gardevor is the most usless pokemon but could also be the most devistating to the earth...........................i might go live on the sun now ( this is the year 8099)
What if it makes a black home out of the other Pokemon? It would immediately disintegrate and stop the threat. OR it could use a black hole made from air, causing an effect kind of similar to cavitation (that thing that makes mantis shrimps so powerful) not to mention suffocation or collapsed lungs.
Just saying, but the Pokedex says that Gardevoir will give its own life for its trainer. Meaning that Gardevoir still does its job(sort of, at the expense of everything on planet Earth).
Good. Thank you. Now I have a more recent account where you admit you are human and that you make mistakes for that plethora of idiots who keep pretending that theory is a shield to pretend you are always right.
The liar here is you! The Pokedex isn't written by the Professors, it's empty when you get it. They task YOU with filling it in! Oak says he is too old to go and do the research himself, so you have to find all the Pokémon and report back
7:57 Our house... In the middle of our house-
hey thanks for making a pokemon video is my birthday and i em pokemon crazy so thank you hoop to see and here moor from you love you
I dont see any problem with the smaller black holes that fizzle out? That says nothing against the dex entry.
Pokemon Sun and Moon? You could continue the multiple universe theory!
Woah, that Aladin reference is actually a perfect way to quickly sum up black holes, props for that Matt! How did you even make the connection?
Smh I hate when American debunk anime logic. You just don’t.
Applying real world physics to psychic energy which doesn't exist in the real world....ok
The music you put in your videos scare me
50hrs of gameplay per game? haha, no
I am a simple man.\nI see a reference to Hitchhiker guide to the galaxy, I upvote
Don't you think that the ONE AND ONLY EXAMPLE you put forward speaks more towards its psychic strength rather than the black holes it self? After all being able to compress matter with only the power of your mind, much like your jokes and over all humor, is no laughing matter.
Should of looked at Macargo the lava snail or regice the really really cold.
The definition said nothing about needing matter, just a gravimetric force.
It could always crush the threat into a tiny black hole
Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell: What if there was a black hole in your pocket?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ\n\nA micro black hole with the mass of a coin, would evaporate in an explosion comparable to a nuclear bomb.
If you're going to say that the first law of thermodynamics applies to Pokémon, you're gonna have a bad time. The Pokémon universe is clearly one that fundamental physics doesn't apply in.
I really hate your voice........
How is this title not clickbait?
I don't see the lie here?\nthere is obviously a middle ground it's not either the moon or a micro pebble\nfirst you need to Quantify the weight of that Pokemons average Psychic power as that is the units that are being expended here\nin order to do that Mattpat needs to go all death battle with the pokemon in question and i'm uncertain that the information is readily available in universe
MATPAT ALL OF YOUR POKEMON THEORIES SUCK GIANT GREAT BALLS!! PLEASE STOP MAKING POKEMOM BASED VIDEOS
I like your death note reference
i was hoping for it to be more about the pokedex and more pokemon, not 1 pokemon :(
1:23 ...the Pokedex, this pocket encyclopedia... I'm gonna' have to stop you there, MatPat. It's not an encyclopedia at all! If it were, it would be called the Pokepedia! Instead, it's a PokeDEX. Why? Because it's a Pokemon index! Indexes are informal collections of information designed to give a general knowledge of a given subject. Thing is? An index isn't held up to anywhere near as high a standard as an encyclopedia. If the author of the index chooses to do proper research and find the real truth about things, all the better, but it is nowhere near required. Which is why some 'dex entries for Exeggcute claim it to be a cluster of eggs, while others say it is merely MISTAKEN for eggs frequently, when the truth is they're more like seeds. Mistakes like the former are acceptable in an index.
Wait... if black holes produce radiation,  if radiation has mass... wouldn't it be pulled back into the black hole
The concept of black hole radiation contradicts the concept of black holes themselves. Enough gravity that light cannot escape. No mass can escape that gravitational pull, therefore radiation from a black hole is absolutely impossible. It's a logical impossibility for both of those concepts to be true.
something my friend explained to me, all of the entries in the poke'dex could just be nothing more than folklore, not an actuality. in the universe of pokemon, the pokemon themselves have been around a lot longer than the dex and considering these creatures are magical, there's a good chance the characters would have stories and legends about the them. sure the professors were the ones to have made the dex, however they themselves never once say they saw these creatures doing some of these really creepy things, and if they did, they're monsters especially in the case of Driftloon
Do giratina (it would probably be interesting) 😉😉
Victini's infinite energy that its Pokédex entries reference cannot actually be infinite. How can you actually fit an infinite energy source into a body with finite volume, let alone one about the size (and indeed, mass) of a Pikachu? Even taking into account the famous Einstein equation E = m*c^2, you would get a whole bunch of potential energy, so certainly enough to make the Tepig's attack overkill even against a Pokémon against which it has a type disadvantage (which I at least think is Samurott), but it's still a finite figure.
Ya know MatPat you say black holes are really dense. You're right. I did this as a science project at school. Black holes are INFINITELY dense!
Can you please analyse Deoxys? In the Pokedex is written something about a Virus.
I love all the references in this video, especially gmm and the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy reference
Matpat, you need to up your Hawking game :). Ultra small black holes are extremely deadly as they convert their entire mass into energy crazy fast.  A 5gram black hole would create a bigger blast than a nuke... many nukes in fact.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8nHBGFKLHZQ\n\nYou can also create black holes without needing great amounts of mass, check out a kugleblitz, basically a black hole created with extreme amounts of light.
You do a debunk on Blastoise and the Cannons on it's back

... what if the big issue is the Pokedex isn't written by the Professors, but by the 10 year old trainers that they are given too... that is part of your job in the first pokemon game, fill the Pokedex...
Black holes ARE NOT invisible. For something to be invisible light must freely pass through it. You would see a blackhole. When you walk into a pitch black room you don't call everything in the dark room invisible.... you call it dark.... like you can't see anything because your eyes are unable to spot light.... Seeing a blackhole would be the same. Not to mention the light bending around the blackhole would be insanely bright. Quasars and blazars are some of the brightest things in our universe.
Guys every video thumbnail on this channel with the game theory logo has matpat in it!
I think that even if those mini black holes that Gardevoir creates, evaporates quickly, they last long enough to protect their trainers from certain projectiles
Let me stop you there at 1:57 you're already wrong it's not a main source of information in the games manga and anime pokedex's are rare and only handed to certain people only the protagonist has one in each. Youngster Joey doesn't have a pokedex. None of the champions even refer to a pokedex except Cynthia
Whether you believe in the validity of IQ ratings or not, I've always questioned the servitude of an Alakazam and it's intelligence quotient of over 5000 (which has nothing on black holes or ability to distort time and space OR....)
You didn't say that Gardevoir's spike thing will impale u if u hug it
this is the pokemon world, where physics is different than what we know.
1) How comes he didn't mention the rule 34?\n\n2) Darumaka. Do Darumaka next.
Renucleus. Just analyse if it is possible to exist.
The real question is how is trubbish alive it literally is a bag of rubbish
Why is this stupid idiot talking about black holes for a Pokemon video so stupid talk about running out of content
What if gardavoir extually uses its psychic abilitys to hold it stable and in place
Quick note: The professors don't do their own research. The children they gives pokedexes to so the research.
Gen 3 for Pokémon go confirmed
This is just one of the many pokedex entries you could say the same thing about XD
The eeveelutions if that's haw u spell it 😃
Came to hear about the multiple lies in the Dex.\n\n\n\nGot a fifteen minute lesson about black holes and one pokemon lol.
How do z-moves and/or mega evolution work
Where is my doctor who part 3 matpat
let's be honest we all know why he covered gardevoir
I would love to see you make a Theory about Warframe's lore.
He does know that the pokemon can use psychic ability doesn't he ?
I already knew this as fact. Time for the extra dark detail about it!\n\n\n\n\nBut accually tho luv ur content
Im sorry but this is not a hate comment but this isnt eveb about the pokedex its about blackholes....
I read the black hole because I used the pause button😐 derp 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
also Gardevoir can freaking eat your dreams, so I bet it could use that power to at least pull up 2 chunks of the earth, squish them together, and create a black hole lasting at least a couple seconds, using it to protect it's trainer!
rhyhorn, how its bones are 1000x harder than human bones
Sorry MatPat. Austin already does The Science!
There are pokemon like yamask who apparently where at one point humans according to the pokedex but this has some holes like how are there human ghosts if they become pokemon when they die?and how do they even know that these pokemon were humans?
But matpat, that's just one pokemon,  not all pokemon can have wrong information on them, right?
Before watching this theory, here is my theory that I really believed for a long time. In the Pokemon games, the pokedex entry that you gain after catching a new pokemon is so inaccurate, it could only be written by a certain 10 year old. I believe that the entries are written by the player on the spot without any prior research. This explains the stupid descriptions like Charmander's tail and the terrible measurements. Wailord's weight per volume puts him as being as dense as hot air balloon.
How does a squirtle- Blastoise hold so much water in them? Can someone explain?
Here is voice acting for the intro!!   Destroyed all of your child hood fnaf was made up of dead children,solved everything in gaming,and was mostly right!!!!da da da!!!😆
You just debunked your Antman can destroy the world theory.
In theory , f=m(g)/r^2. So so even if you squeeze 2 atoms together to a point where it is small enough that it can collapse on its own gravity , Ta-da , mini backhole. \n Also note that hawking radiation is caused by vacuum fluctuations.  \nNote 2, note that is failed to maintain its gravity to stay together , release energy \nE=mc^2 lama
But you ignored the whole it uses psychic energy to create the black hole it, out right stated the creation technique which can be interpreted to mean that it uses its psychic energy to condense the mass but it could also mean that it creates one out of pure psychic energy which would be a completely different entity then a black hole but may be explained best by using a black hole as an example. Also I think it should be acknowledged that true psychic abilities are not necessarily covered by science so its hard to say what rules of the physical world it obeys and follows gardevoir may create a true black hole of mass but through psychic energy be able to ignore its gravity and manipulate how the force acts on its environment like how we are able to direct a vacuum cleaner it may be a tool she can use.\n\nJust curious about your thoughts on this? Still love the show though.
Hello Matt, I know you often read the comments on your videos, and I really hope you read this one too. This is my first comment ever, and the reason I chose to make this my first comment is because of the videos you made on fake news. They changed my perception on the world and helped me realize that things aren't always as they seem. I'm new to your channels, but since I discovered them I've pretty much marathoned 'em. What I'm trying to say is that you're content is great, and I hope you continue to open peoples eyes. Good luck and God speed.
4:22 Me: You missed an opportunity to make an Interstellar reference 10 seconds later Yyeeeeessss
If black holes absorb light, how are you reading this? - lol nice one (10:22)
But what if Gardevoir makes the opponent into a black hole?
I know that this one video is just covering what the description but... gardevoir (in the anime since a player can choose different moves) normally has shadow ball. so its probably referring to that in a tall tale.
arceus coming out of an egg and then being king of pokemon
Yes but assuming Gardevoir's telekinetic powers are formidable enough, wouldn't it be possible for it to create a black hole within its opponent? My logic is that even though this black hole would last at most 10^-27 seconds, it could still do lots of damage within a body instead of a vacuum like in the particle accelerator.
The pokedex is still in Beta, \nevery game the professor mentions that you and a few more trainers are trialing it. \nThat's why it's your job is to complete the pokedex.
Did mat pat straight up call the 10 commandments bull
wait what ? Black holes produce heat ? ludicrous, where do you get your info really ?
hey matpat can you make another video on fnaf or bendy and the ink machine ?
Please do the Jesus Pokemon, pleaseeeeee or dialga, idk one of the Legendary Pokemons and I'll be Satisfied 150% still i'll  be pleased mat （＾ω＾）
Gotta give points on that Hitchhikers reference game theory.
There should be a theory of krabby actually being a mantis shrimp and not a crab since mantis shrimps create cavitation bubbles which have a strong similarity to in the cartoon where krabby signature attack is bubble beam
You're making a big deal out of this.
I think a better much more accepted theory about the pokedex's inaccuracy is that it's written by 10 year olds. The plot of the games is you collect data on pokemon via your pokedex which then fills itself out. If you look at some of the entries they obviously seem written by a child. Check Alakazam for a good example.
Something on how arceus is the god of Pokemon despite mew being the first Pokemon would be awesome.
it could just make the black hole out of the danger so yah
Soooo.... what I'm gathering is that Thor's hammer is heavier... than a microscopic black hole with the mass of a moon? Tbh I have no honest why I thought of that. I'm stupid. If you had my twelve year old mind, you're understand.
Imagine if Wikipedia was full of lies.\n\n\n\n\n\nLol
You should do how deadly would it be to fall off rainbow road
Please do the fake pikachu one that would be great!
torterra ! hey mat pat how does it have a tree at its back. like so as he could see
Dear matpat, Just a quick question, with fnaf4 is it possible the stuffed toys we see disappear at the end of the game are in the box at the end of the game we cant open, if you think about it, it kinda makes sense but i dont know if this has already been covered already, please like this so Matpat can see because i really want to see this covered
Here's a Pokemon MatPat could do: Magcargo. Mainly because of it's Pokemon Sapphire entry: Magcargo's body temperature is approximately 18,000 degrees F. Water is vaporized on contact. If this Pokémon is caught in the rain, the raindrops instantly turn into steam, cloaking the area in a thick fog.
Bulbasaur, please, I want to make sure my favorite Pokemon is perfect. Please.
Your eyes perceive little to no light as black, so by not seeing anything  you are seeing black. It's like saying that you are seeing nothing, so it's not nothing, it is invisible.
Maybe her psychic powers can make that the black hole not emit radiation

Matpat analyse mimikyu
Maybe they meant to say that it can manipulate gravity around it rather than creating a black hole. It would make more sense that way since there are pokemon and moves that deal with manipulating gravitational pull on themselves and their opponents
Gardevoir could just compress the object/creature imposing danger on its trainer into a blackhole, which would be too small and immediately fizzle into the air as hawking radiation.
Yeah okay, the black hole thing is incredibly silly, but the amount of Rule 34 on that thing is absurd!!\n(Semi-)Joking aside, I'll never understand pokemon titles. Like Gardevoir being the Embrace pokemon when [a] no dex entry ever really explains that, and [b] it has that spiky-heart-crystal-doodad on its chest. I always assumed it would have to be soft, like fleshy, otherwise... well the internet is full of embrace jokes.\nAnother one that leaps to mind is Arcanine being the Legendary pokemon. What makes big-ol' hellhound legendary?
I got that hitchhikers guide to the galaxy reference with the wale and flower
But what if a cubic metre of air (mass ~1.3kg) was condensed into a black hole in the centre of an attack. It would have a lifetime of 1.8*10^-16 seconds, but could surely disrupt the attack velocity, energy, etc. If not, the movement of air would also affect the attack, disrupting it in some way. If it compressed 10 cubic metres of air, the black hole would have a lifetime of 1.8*1^-13 s and even more mass to disrupt the attack. This also isn't considering the heat that would be generated by compressing so much mass so quickly. My point in this argument is that the black hole does not need to be stable to affect the environment and if the description was accurate it would be beneficial not to have a stable black hole as that would destroy the earth as stated. Also there is plenty of mass lying around that could be used, and wouldn't be noticed missing. Although it takes tremendous energy to compress matter past its neutron degeneracy pressure, is there an accurate or reliable scale or description of what psychic powers are? Idk, I thought of this argument and found a calculator online.
The fun of this was soaked by a black hole
But what if Gardevoir used its powers to condense the threat/enemy into a black hole? That would turn out okay, because the black hole would be unstable and simply evaporate, rather than destroying the world.
Please can you do Pikachu?
Two actual Pokedex facts:\nMagcargo. It's literally hotter than the sun.\nAlso one day a kid woke up as a Kadabra. Sounds legit.
And yes they do evaporate extremely quickly but what if you make to many of them ir may be by minute amounts it still takes bacteria and matter of all sorts... all the numbers will add up to a big number.... please think about what your talking about scientists. Dont destroy your own planet.
Have you heard of whats called different universes?
I can't stand these black hole analogies. They're so bad \nI hope he ends up mentioning micro black holes that you can create from two particles mashing into each other which then evaporate to hawking radiation. \nI dunno how a pokemon would want to deal a neither world destroying attack nor an attack that is too small to even notice. There is no black hole size where this would be the case. \nSo yeah Matt you did it. You called BS on pokemon physics. Good job
well he just ruined my favorite pokemon, thanks matpat XD. seriously tho keep up the good work :)
Mat, the FNAF timeline is messed up, cuz the phone guy in the second says there's no doors this time even though the time era is BEFORE FNAF 1. To be honest the whole damn TIMELINE is messed up. Please theory this, or tell me at me Twitter @DukeTheNuke2.
I think wailord would do for a good exposing
11:07 MAT BILL NYE ISN'T A REAL SCIENTIST OMG!!!
Do Rayquaza and how it gets the energy to mega evolve despite not having a trainer and also, how it somehow consumes meteors for energy?
13:19 fun fact as black holes gain mass their density drops
So what if instead of using mass, psychic abilities alone are used to distort the fabric of space (which is from my understanding, those distortions cause gravity) and this distortion causes the same effects as a black hole without the need of any mass? Really would appreachiate feedback here though!
Matpat please do a theory about gravity falls series, it has a lot of mystery to unlock for you <3
A microscopic black hole is what is needed to leap in time in the time drama anime steins gate,maybe the microscopic black hole is used to reverse time although that kills gardevoir in the process since she has to maintain a the black hole for long enough .
Maybe MatPat should do a theory about mega evolution or z-moves or maybe even both like which is superior!
But here is the thing... it's a game.. their black holes don't follow the laws of physics.. \n\nThat said... yah, a lot of stuff in the Dex are just legends and myths added in... and it's more for us players than for the characters.
Didn't Austin already cover this?
When he was talking about black holes, anyone jump to make sure they still had our gravity? 😂
What you forget is that when a black hole completely evaporates it releases a tremendous amount of energy. If a black hole with the mass of a penny were to completely evaporate, it would cause an explosion larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. So, if gardevoir were to create mini black holes she could attack opponents with controlled explosions.
Gardevoir has telekinetic powers. Expending all of its energy, it uses this power to SUSTAIN a black hole. Telekinesis is one of those abilities that is more powerful the better the user understands what they're doing. The Gardevoir knows what it's doing. It's pulling matter from all around it into the black hole, thus sustaining it artificially in a way that natural black holes simply cannot do themselves.\nYour science is right, but your understanding of the game is lacking in this case. A little bit disappointing.
Matpat!! Please do a theory on Duck Season, the VR game. It's mysterious and would be a great episode! Like if you agree and so Matpat can see.
Yes but magic and stuff
wouldnt it still be considered a small blackhole if they compressed the thing that was trying to hurt their trainer? and the attacker would be radiation that would probably stop being radiated and become part of earth again.... and it does say to protect them meaning they might only use this as a last hope type thing as creating blackholes and bypassing the effects of gravity (it does say they dont feel gravity but doesnt mean it wont affect them) they would probably be able to detect human emotion.... and hopefully the emotion of the things that it might need to destroy so it feels bad but....
you don't even need to go that far to prove it wrong: creating a black hole large enough to fit a human would fail at protecting it since said trainer would just get crushed by the presure
Make a video about Entei and if his roars, or a loud enough sound, could make volcanoes erupt.
if there’s is anything about Empoleon , maybe it then ?
I really appreciate the 8-bit horror music.
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Professors in the Pokémon world are dicks.
Isn't the Color black also known as the lack of color, and because a black hole has no light (thus meaning no color) work for a name? Like symbolism or something?
Aren't you overlooking the fact that they can teleport?\n\nWhy bother doing anything with particles to make a black hole when they could potentially just recreate similar spatial distortion withe their phenomenal cosmic mind powers?
your wrong, after the small black hole evaporates it creates an explosion powerful enough to destroy earth.
But Pokémon has no physics\n\n\n\n\n\nU can capture god but can’t burn a tree
Black holes aren't invisible. That's not what invisible means. Or black.\n\nA black hole absorbs all light that crosses it's event horizon. Leaving aside that they arr frequently surrounded by orbiting matter, a more critical point is... They block light!\nThus, if a black hole were to pass in front of something, you would be unable to see through the black hole to the objects behind it.\nThis makes it... Black.\nBlack being the abbsence of colour, or in theory, the absense of visible light.\nPaint cannot ever truly absorb ALL light, but note that the whole point of an object being black as opposed to grey or white is  that it neithrr reflects nor emits large amounts of light. Thus, the less light an object is capable of emitting or reflecting, the closer it is to being truly 'black'.\nFor an object to be invisible however, it has to not be detectable.\nBut a black object held in front of a bright, coloured background is very visible indeed.\nWhat is NOT so visible, is a transparent object, such as glass.\nThus an invisible object would not be one that absorbs or reflects light, but one which transmits it without ever absorbing or distorting any of it.\nNone of which describes a black hole.\nThus, a black hole is indeed black, and not invisible. What renders black holes invisible is trying to look at one against a background with little to no contrast.
But anything can become a black hole just neutron stars is heavy enough to make one about every time earth into a peanut would make a black hole so... aye that's pretty neat
Plz do one about our lord and savior Arceus and the ones more close to him.
Do a game theory on ROBLOX!
10:23 I don’t know
I refuse to accept that the Pokedex entries aren't ALL true ALL the time.
i like the ksp music, noice
Do Arceus THE GOD OF ALL POKEMON
Can Yveltal actually absorb all life on earth if it dies? Is that actually possible?
You have to pay after 2 samples, I would know. \n\nPs. Yandere waifu.
Gardevoir makes a sphere of intense artificial gravity, simulating a black hole.
do alakazam.\nhis pokedex entry.\njust that.\n(about the little kid)
I can read it cuz I'm magic
I feel like Matt really just wanted to make a video about black holes
*radiation has energy which can be converted into mass\nRadiation itself doesn't have mass.
What if Gardevoir would keep on shooting subatomic particles before it disintegrates?
one problem, The move moon blast....
You lost me at conservation of matter.
ok 1 i am at 2:22 right now but as we know research and facts can be debunked as new evedence is presented. Things can be thought right and never re evaluated through time as we have seen in history before... that is until someone actually dose look at it more in depth. The Pokedex is rewriten almost every game meaning new information in the pokemon world is found also meaning they know that this process exists and that the knolage on pokemon would be in a grey area untill a set time that they have cold hard facts figured out which could take many many years. also... blub blub
Where is part 2 of indoctrination theory
Wait! One Pokémon?! The Pokedex tells us Lies about ONE Pokémon and you say its full of it!!\nSorry. Nice Episode, but the Title was a bit misleading.
Um... If that is actually how a black hole works (I've followed up on this part of your theory and even theoretical scientist can't really confirm that is actually how a black hole works), wouldn't the black holes sucking in all the light actually make it black not invisible. Or rather we perceive it as black because everything around it is  bouncing off light and in contrast to that it makes the hole actually look black? If it were invisible we would see through it and in order to see through it but still be there it has to refract some sort of light doesn't it?
Gardevoir just turns the enemy pokemon into a black hole, but good game MattPat.
Black is the absence of light.
Can you do a theory on call of duty zombies storyline
Shadowball looks like a black hole, but obviously isn't because video game logic. Fake news.
Honestly I learned so much about black holes I forgot this episode was about pokemon.
what if gardevoir creates the black hole then hugs its trainer so they wouldnt get sucked in?
Can you do a game theory on Ruby Quest? It's a creepy click and point adventure game found on http://evilcorporation.com.br/rubyquest/ and while it seems like there's a pretty easy meaning to find due to it being connected to the poem The Metal Glen by Willam Murdoch, I'm pretty sure you could find something more than worthwhile.

Maybe analyze Gallade next?
Here's the thing - if Gardevoir can manipulate singular particals, couldn't it just seriously mess with an object, or person, nearby?\nAs in kill 'em ded, no blackholes required
Analyse Magneton, aside from the fact that their non-biological what kind of magnetism keeps them stuck together? Cuase whatever it is it ain't ferromagnetism as their not pulling in everything that ferromagnetic around them 24/7.
golbat is interesting to me can you please try it
*comments about the next dr who theory*
Loved the Good Mythical Morning reference!
10:22, because its 4 O'Clock and im still on my computer and the light of it is bouncing off it
Ok let me explain something the pokedex is an online encyclopaedia you use in the pokemon manga pokemon adventures at the very moment red gets his pokedex oak says  i want you to find all the pokemon and write down everything you learn about them  on to the pokemon encyclopaedia so then ethier you the trainer finds a legendry and write down what they learn about them and if someone found it before them they can lie but you the trainer can fix it you're welcome.
I would love to hear about mew two and the genetics behind him (since he was created and all that jazz).
How about Magikarp or Alakazam or Magcargo? Or Tyranitar, Charmander getting surfed by water and still not dying from no tail fire
I'm gonna have to call bs. Radiation is light, right? Then how could it actually escape a black hole? I'm personally convinced by the idea that it gives off radiation is nothing more than light slingshot off the black hole's gravity like most science fiction. Otherwise, there are actual particles that are not affected by gravity to any extent.\n\nGuess which one seems more likely, but who am I to reasonably question science.
Is there a reason why Earth physics work for the Poké-verse? It didn't in the Assassin's Creed world! [Leap of Faith - video]. \nAlso can anyone tell me if FilmTheory has created a theory based on the Big Hero 6 portals?
matpat plz do mimikyu or type null I'm so intrigued\ni mainly want to see type null
Oh, who knows creating a black hole as an attack is not possible, so I guess a Squirtle squirting out water obviously way more than its body size is complete fine then? Or basically all psychic attacks, totally scientifically possible, eh?
which POKEMON to analyze next? More like next POKEMON to destroy...
I like how he shows eggman running faster than sonic in the intro
Bad science. This channel's theory, not the Pokedex. Completely lacks understanding of singularities. First, the minimum size and energy of small black hole are not certain. Secondly, assuming the rate of Hawking radiation is as predicted a 70 metric ton blackhole would be stable for about a year, 20 metric tons about a second. Something the mass of the moon would basically last longer than the current age of the universe. Now a micro-singularity weighing about 20 metric tons would still be lethal if not due to gravity due to the radiation released we are talking 389,740 megatonnes of TNT worth of energy in a second. The radiation would definitely kill you and probably everything on the planet. A black hole with the energy of a kilogram of TNT would have a mass of like 0.05 micrograms and only need to last a fraction of a second and could still harm any threat to its trainer. The question would be how the hell does it shield its trainer from the radiation. Also, black holes aren't invisible more like if you could actually see it it would be black since black is the absence of light. Now due to gravity bending light, it would kind of be like a lens bending light around it but I am too lazy to work out the math right now. The reason we can't directly see black holes in space is not because they are invisible but because the accretion disk is basically generating massive amounts of radiation mostly in the form of x-rays and the blackhole itself doesn't directly emit light and absorbs the light headed toward it so there is no way to see it since the empty space also doesn't directly emit light. basically a black body against a mostly black background would be invisible.  But I imagine like a marble on a tablecloth if space had way more stars and empty space was not black these black holes would not be invisible. Meaning if an entity ever made one on a planet it could be visible and probably larger than expected since while the sigularity would be microscoping the well creating the lensing could be significantly larger.
Okay, first off,\nDon't question Pokémon. Anything's possible in the world of Nintendo.\nAnd second,\nIt's actually Shadow Ball. Oh well, whatever.\nAlso, I want myself analyzed, please.
I want to see why wormadons (i think i spelled it wrong)can stick in branches,and what insect does it convey as?
Hey can we get a bloodborne theory?
Do Snorlax please! Weighing up to 1000lbs, needing to eat 900lbs of food EVERY DAY!
Snorlax is gonna kill us all ... right?
new theory\n\ngardevoir is an evil psychopath bent on the destruction of the entire earth. or maybe it does this to save the universe by stopping Mewtwo. just a thought.
Wouldn't you be able to see the black hole because of the things that are far behind the black hole?
Can you plz do a theory on pikmin
I hate this the black holes would immidately die bai hawking radation.
Where in new Zealand are you go to south aukland
What happens if you smash nokias into each other in the LHC?
Kinda dont wana ruin ur rant but did u watch the first episode of pokemon? The pokedex is a prototype that is wrong and very incomplete , there are several pokemon just not in it, and Ash receives it to help complete it , and spoiler ash is an idiot that fights rock pokemon with a pikachu.... Just saying Ash doesnt know what a blackhole is....
The issue is that (according to the Pokedex) Gardevoir uses psychokinetic power to distort dimensions in Sapphire, and psychic power in Black/White. So we know that some kind of psychic power is at play, which deals with the realm of nonexistent forces and magic. If that is the case, then the creation and utility of black holes is possible the moment magic is allowed in the context. Magic can be used to justify any questionable claim. How doesn't the world get destroyed when Gardevoir uses makes a black hole? Magic. Why don't pokemon die when they are hit with extremely powerful attacks? Magic. The mention that Gardevoir is not affected by gravity should have already notified you about the involvement of magic. In our understanding of the universe, nothing is unaffected by gravity. Then what is Gardevoir made of? Perhaps magic? \n\nAlso, your claim that science is lying to us with the term 'black holes' is misleading at best. Yes, the term may be inaccurate for its description, but it is not a lie to have a misleading term. Black holes are a shorthand way to describe these things in space; it's a name. \n\nOh, and the title of the video? FULL OF LIES, you say? You have only made a (questionable) claim about one pokemon's pokedex entry. One out of several hundred pokedex entries is not sufficient to make a FULL OF LIES claim. Perhaps a more accurate clickbait title would be Game Theory: The Pokedex LIES TO US. That title is in line with your claim, which I believe is incorrect anyway. \n\nFeel free to discuss and point out any errors in my thinking. I am happy to admit my wrongs. \n\nTL;DR: \nGardevoir uses psychic power, which is essentially magic. Magic can justify anything, including the use of black holes.
seems like this should've been an Austin episode...
Larvitar and the fact that it eats mountains, maybe?
technically since black holes suck in light you would notice a growing darkness near one as the light is removed forming a shadow, which also means looking away from a black hole would be brighter than looking at one (as looking away from one you would observe the light getting sucked into the blackhole and as a result, in your direction). think of it as a light that emits darkness
please I want to see salamance
Matpat can repeat the same statement so many times in one video that a small black hole will form and suck all my interest away.
Here's a Fire Emblem theory: The Weapon Triangle (Swords beats Axes, Axes beats Lances, Lances beat Swords): Can that it work in real life?
So mewtwo is not the strongest pokemon?
Too nerdy for Game Theory? Ha! NOTHING IS TOO NERDY FOR GAME THEORY!!!
make a threoy about how greninja lost to charizrad
man i love me some POKEYMANS!!!!
I like the little subtleties of these videos of his, like when he said black holes suck in the light an image of Light Yagami from death note went into it.
it's pokemon, who's to say that it is the same world where physics are the same? in the pokemon universe we have creatures that tear time and space, that create worlds,  that can travel travel between universes. you look too deep into a world that could be completely different, for someone who uses the multiverse theory often, you should take this into consideration.
Next time you talk about black holes can you slip in the word Spaghettification ?\nNot sure if I spelled it right but it's supposed to be a homogeneous gravitational field caused by extreme tidal forces, in the most extreme cases, near black holes,the stretching is so powerful that no object can withstand it, no matter how strong its components. Within a small region the horizontal compression balances the vertical stretching so that small objects being spaghettified experience no net change in volume.\nWell it says so in Wikipedia.
can someone just tell pat. its just a game ;'))))))))))))))))))))).
Wikipedia is full of alot of lies don't trust it it can be edited by anyone. 0-0
And then you realize that one of gardevoir's attacks is Moonblast..... throwing a black hole at a pokemon?
Does that mean that Rick in Rick and Morty's portal gun has something to do with black holes? Maybe you could do a theory on that, idk.
Um, the pokedex never states that the black holes are SUCCESSFUL in protecting their trainer. And by the way something that is truly black is literally invisible. Black = the absence of light. There is no such thing as black light.
This video is dumb... like... really dumb... dumb enough for me to think about unsubscribing. Also this video is really padded out which could be 1/2 the time.
Mew; Genesis Supernova, Mewtwo: part human, Blaine is the dad where ditto used to be in the DNA
I think Gardevoir uses their psychic powers to make the small black hole stable
what if gardevoir protect her trainers from them self\nyou know\nhuman cant be trusted with their nature?\nlmew
How is Gardevoir the embrace pokemon? She has a freaking blade coming out her chest!
Also tiny black holes explode with light, so they could be used as a weapon.
If black holes absorb light, how are you reading this?
yes a pokemon video. ps flying types are the best.
Isn't pure black an ABSENSE of light?\n\nAlso, the pokedex RECORDS information AUTOMATICALLY, meaning it's not directly written by the professors.
14:36 that picture is my screensaver!!!!!
This was a cool episode because I was fascinated by black holes and wonder if mega Man 9 black hole bomb would work\n\nCan you please do an episode on the regi trio their Pokedex says their industuctable and is it even possible for ice metal and rock to be so
Wait if we can't see a black hole and they accidentally made one and thier just playing POKEMON GO that means..... We die? And wait how do we disable it or destroy it oh wait we can't destroy..... Wow i hate scientists......
i know im breaking the sixth commanmet but where is the 3rd doctor who?
6:40    Is it just me or does that background music sound like Kerbal Space Program?\n\n\nEdit:\nNo its not just me, went further into the vid, MAOR Kerbal Space Program music.
I love the ksp music
Sometimes we get things wrong on this channel.\n\nA way to reduce this is to play the game first before toughing it. Like TF2, or from what I heard, Undertale when you did the ness is Sans... I still don't see it.\n\nAlso, what's the tech of the Pokemon universe? I assume it's the same as ours but they use Pokeballs that can contain things muuuuuch larger than the ball itself, which can compress... What's to stop the gardevoire from keeping the Black hole contained? and wouldn't a Shadow ball look like a Black Hole? It certainly looks like a void. Everyone knows what a shadow ball looks like but the question becomes, what happens if it's altered slightly. If your creating it with mental powers then you can limit the mass going into it and also pull things into it. Say the thing that's trying to kill the trainer.\n\nPokemon's weird and with physics different than our own, it's going to be tough to judge
i LOVE this into
I want to know how eevee can evolve into all of those types and how the heck that happens? I want answers MatPat!!!
Me : I mean hey, don't fight it too much guys. At least Hypnos/Drowzees don't exist.
yay pennywise was on the balloon
I want that kitty face LEGO block! So cute! :3
The Pokedex is FULL OF LIES!\n\nThere was just one lie tho
1 month into a middle school animation class and I can do all of the animation in your videos lol\nNo offense to ur no talent editors
This video taught me so much stuff that tomorrow when i go to school ima tell my teacher how the pokedex lied to us because HE also plays pokemon
I hear Spielberg is in talks to direct the 3rd season opener. Really hope he does it. Would be a [literal] return to his 80s roots.
I love how this is trending with only 80k views.

I love how this is trending with only 80k views.

hahahaha... that was just plain mean.. funny shit though...
It's easy to laugh when they have no idea of the context. When Nintendo released the NES Classic, many stores were only given about 4 or so and then they never got any more. Most of them ended up being bought by scalpers who wanted to turn a profit, meaning a tremendous amount of people who wanted the system never got the chance to buy one, especially after Nintendo announced they were cancelling their run of the system. It's only natural to assume the same would happen here seeing as that's just how Nintendo has been running their ship for a while now, so can you really blame these two for waiting for hours to make absolute certain they got the thing they wanted?
someone explain how this is trending?
they can laugh all they want but if the news chick wanted a limited edition COACH purse she be waiting in line or the male anchor  same thing just a limited edition doll for kids for his daughter or grand daughter he be in line also. yet when it comes to a console hahahahaha besides this year for the  latest iphone not the X but the 8 no lines yet this November  their will be lines for it yet no one will be laughing  yet i think waiting for a console is more worth it  rather than a damn phone.
Fox news... lmaoo
oh man--  i keep reviewing this-- hillarious well hhmm so i saw 6 or so games that would be fun to play and replay most ive never played before so ya sorry nintendo  if i was to egt a snes id like to play  5-6 gameso n this system true and some other oens i liked that arnt included on this version heres to a snes mini 2
Watch him become a meme somehow
Dick move pretty funny though. I'm glad I wasn't the only one waiting for my SNES classic
Wait, what's the joke?
lol I like when he goes to interview the dude and it just cuts off
The guy in line lol he turn in to a meme
Mm. Good lesson. The moral of the story is that when it ain't you, it's funny.
2K views and trending wtf youtube
god damn scalpers
Too funny!
Well deserved laugh.

To everyone asking, the game is an app, available on iOS and Android.

LOL this trailer just spoiled me a lot, I just started watching
If they make a stranger things game, I don’t want it to follow the shows plot. I’d want it to be a completely original story.\n\nedit:unless this already is an original story
Less than 300 likes and 27 comments but it’s on trending?!?!??! \nOk YouTube
Lol wat I have more subs than this company:0
this looks just like Zelda!
I almost blew up my hand playing with dry ice.
Here before this blows up, it's only a matter of time. This looks awesome, but please, please, PLEASE don't make a bad game adaptation! We all want to see a good quality game and not something rushed and thrown together just to earn some quick money.
Omg want.\nDoesn't it come out Halloween?
Looks great! But please...pretty please. Bring it to the Nintendo Switch?
I wish they'd do a Stranger Things TellTale game instead
I want a stranger things game similar to Friday the 13

is this a joke or is it real?
I need this to happen
This deserves no dislikes, omg so much nostalgia 🤗
hahahaha... that was just plain mean.. funny shit though...
It's easy to laugh when they have no idea of the context. When Nintendo released the NES Classic, many stores were only given about 4 or so and then they never got any more. Most of them ended up being bought by scalpers who wanted to turn a profit, meaning a tremendous amount of people who wanted the system never got the chance to buy one, especially after Nintendo announced they were cancelling their run of the system. It's only natural to assume the same would happen here seeing as that's just how Nintendo has been running their ship for a while now, so can you really blame these two for waiting for hours to make absolute certain they got the thing they wanted?
someone explain how this is trending?
they can laugh all they want but if the news chick wanted a limited edition COACH purse she be waiting in line or the male anchor  same thing just a limited edition doll for kids for his daughter or grand daughter he be in line also. yet when it comes to a console hahahahaha besides this year for the  latest iphone not the X but the 8 no lines yet this November  their will be lines for it yet no one will be laughing  yet i think waiting for a console is more worth it  rather than a damn phone.
Fox news... lmaoo
oh man--  i keep reviewing this-- hillarious well hhmm so i saw 6 or so games that would be fun to play and replay most ive never played before so ya sorry nintendo  if i was to egt a snes id like to play  5-6 gameso n this system true and some other oens i liked that arnt included on this version heres to a snes mini 2

hahahaha... that was just plain mean.. funny shit though...
It's easy to laugh when they have no idea of the context. When Nintendo released the NES Classic, many stores were only given about 4 or so and then they never got any more. Most of them ended up being bought by scalpers who wanted to turn a profit, meaning a tremendous amount of people who wanted the system never got the chance to buy one, especially after Nintendo announced they were cancelling their run of the system. It's only natural to assume the same would happen here seeing as that's just how Nintendo has been running their ship for a while now, so can you really blame these two for waiting for hours to make absolute certain they got the thing they wanted?
someone explain how this is trending?
they can laugh all they want but if the news chick wanted a limited edition COACH purse she be waiting in line or the male anchor  same thing just a limited edition doll for kids for his daughter or grand daughter he be in line also. yet when it comes to a console hahahahaha besides this year for the  latest iphone not the X but the 8 no lines yet this November  their will be lines for it yet no one will be laughing  yet i think waiting for a console is more worth it  rather than a damn phone.
Fox news... lmaoo
oh man--  i keep reviewing this-- hillarious well hhmm so i saw 6 or so games that would be fun to play and replay most ive never played before so ya sorry nintendo  if i was to egt a snes id like to play  5-6 gameso n this system true and some other oens i liked that arnt included on this version heres to a snes mini 2

Wait, what's the joke?
lol I like when he goes to interview the dude and it just cuts off

Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
This video infuriates me so much!\n\nHey, lets make a video about gaming in the Soviet Bloc. Obvious choice are the countries in the former Soviet Union, but nah, F those Ruskies. How about Bulgaria or Romania, countries  outside what most Westerners consider the Soviet Bloc? You just answered your own question! How about Yugoslavia, a sui generis country with a Marxist-Leninist ideology but outside the Soviet Bloc? Who cares about those losers? OK, lets focus on East Germany, a geopolitical region that outside of 50-some-odd years of communist rule in nonetheless an integral part of Western Civilization? Bingo!
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.
Dude, you really have a lot of talent. As cliche as it sounds, this really has a lot of meaning in the scientific community as it stands in america. The government holding back its citizens in scientific discovery is mind boggling.
Thats a new subject matter. DANKA  I am makeing subscrib to wonderful YouTubes channel.
How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the Денде?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
This is pure ideology.
When Clair de Lune started playing at the beginning I stated tearing up, god dammit Danganronpa V3
This is REAL games journalism. We got SUper Bunnyhop here investigating cool as shit history on videogames and digging up contact info of developers from 30+ years ago, while Kotaku just says you're sexist for playing Minecraft.
It is true the COCom list made it impossible for us as teenies to get hightech from western Europe, but these rules did not aplly to electronic scrap. Friends of mine in West Berlin sendet me vie postal service carefully seperatet/cutted parts in several packages and we buildet and soldet everything up again. :-) These C4 plus/ C-64 looked a little bit strange afterwards, but we had a working computer at the end. We were creative :-).
This is some real games journalism bruh
I live in east Germany. :) The video is very good as always.
Makes me think of the gaming history of my own country somehow - especially the ripoff part haha
MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
I got an update for you, the iron courtain doesn't exist anymore, nice bait fgt
would love to see more videos like this Georgie porgie.
In Hungary the curtain was a bit more loose, so there were zx Spectrums at schools, and also c64 and amiga smuggled from Austria. Videoton also made some pong console clones, and there was the fairly popular Yellow Cartridge Nintendo ( sárga kazettás ) clone console.\nThere's a documentary about the Commodore64 game developement called Moleman 4 - Longplay.\nAlso all those Trabants make me feel nostalgic. We had one until 2007.
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
1:05 I am German and I did not know that East Germany had video games at that point in time either.
ah well, the memories. As a eastern germany kid the only games I was able to play until the wall was torn down were the one in Polyplay and I loved them. Thankfully we have a Polyplay in a local bar here.
I think of all soviet block countries Poland was in best gaming shape.
As an eastern german it is nice to watch a video about this topic. It was a strange and weird time for us here. Also interesting because I visited the Computerspielmuseum this spring too and it was really interesting, absolute worth it.  Perhaps an idea for the future would be a video about the console usage in eastern europe after 89. I know here and also in brasil the Sega Master System was the dominant console for a short time. My first own console was a Sega MS II with Sonic included until I got an PSX as a birthday gift, I skipped the 16 bit era entirely. \n\nBy the way, I am not so sure that Yager Entertainment is an east german company, the buisness address is in Kreuzberg, West-Berlin. But the managing director Timo Ullmann studied at the Humbolt university, East-Berlin. Berlin not really east or west more its own thing so hard to tell. But this is not that important.
Keep in mind, that Densi dound its way to Russia after fall of USSR and was, essentially, a cheap alternative of NES, since the pric of the latter was around 2 or 3 (maybe more) montly family budgets.
That was a fantastic video! Thank you!
Please make a video about gaming in communist Poland. It's actually quite an interesting topic.
Germany was pretty fucked up at the time.\nWestern germany was pretty much enslaving eastern germany to produce a lot of products like furniture and many other things for a low price while eastern germany didn't even have acces to many of those things.\nAnd the reason why this was going on for so long is simply because western germany  only made profits while the east wasn't able to develop and fight back.\nThere are many stories out there and if you got caught trying to cross the well protected border, you were either caught and put behind bars if you were lucky or shot on the spot like a dog in the streets.\nYou also were not allowed to leave the country (GDR or DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) as we call it in germany) without permission to do so wich still was pretty restricted to say the least. \nTo this day, western germany is much more developed and has higher wages than eastern germany BUT the cost of living there is also much higher.\nIt's still pretty fucked up in my opinion and with all the new people streaming in from the southeast, the government is putting a lot of money into programs for them like learning german and everything surrounding work and stuff wich leaves germans in the dust.\nBut I guess in 3 to 5 years everything will get better once all those people got integrated into our society.\nSorry for drifting off lol
Down with communist and socialist.
Great vid George! A West-German approves.\nAnd just the right amount of Hoff - you brilliant bastard you!
Honestly getting a guided tour at the Stasi museum was the final nail in the coffin for believing communism could ever work. It's basically just one giant den of nepotism.
so let me be your token german george.....  the DDR had video games?°_°
East Germany was famous for manufacturing the world's largest microchips.
for thanksgiving i am thankful for this channel.
That song that played at 8:51 does anyone know what it is? I keep hearing it randomly in different forms whenever I hear something USSR related...
Vinyl records were once  used to store computer data????? I honestly didnt know that was possible. Fascinating.
Fantastic video as always George! Thanks :)
danm, this is great. Thanks George!
Impressive work George, well done!
This is so interesting, thank you!
I visited that museum last year and they've got a lot of interesting things in there. Berlin is a fantastic destination in general. The food, beer and nightclubbing are next level.
Good Video. And i thank our capitalistic comrades (Patreons) to make this available to the working class. (And that it didn't took 5 years trto make. Comrad Georg is such an overachiever)
The biggest praise I can give you as a colleague doing political journalism in Denmark is that you are perhaps the only actual games journalist. As in, you do a story, choose an angle, do actual research, interviews, sort through prior work in the area, work the story and piece together something original and enlightening. All the while tackling each subject and game with an adult eye for balance, history and nuance... well, except for when you talk about MGS, maybe ;)\n\nThe fact that you have an education while most of your contemporary colleagues are basically amateur bloggers really shines through.\n\nKudos, man. It's a joke that you're not looked on as an obvious main inspiration for the genre of video game journalism.
this was a really well done and interesting video article.  Good Job George, and thank you for the content you put out.
The GDR was actually called the DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) in German.\n\nPretty big missed opportunity for a joke there George.
that elephant is trespassing on mario world 1-2. tsk
Thank you George! Very interesting and informative, and one of those things you never know you wanted to know until you find out about it
I always freaking forget:\nWhat's the name of the piano piece at the start of the video?
sure. first thing you make when you get your hands on a cpu is a game. then some work for the socialist threadmill
Regan was more responsible for it than any other individual person...don't know why you would add that little text.
Man, what an interesting video.
Poor east german kids didn't have a nes, poor latvian kids didn't have a potato.
This is not interesting. Enough 'travel logs' Herodotus
As someone who lived in the region that was formerly known as 'West Germany' (lived pretty close to the French Border, as a matter of fact) for 10 years, I actually find it interesting to learn about what was going on in the Eastern half since I never got to go anywhere near the former GDR in my lifetime. I find it amazing how East Germans were able to improvise on how they got their video games and such. \n\nIt's still a shame that you could still feel the effects of this to this very day.
Absolutely fascinating. Love hearing history about the Cold War.
Noodles Man, aren't Germany's kid stories more gory than these games?
The Dendy is actually a Taiwanese clone console,its just sold in Russia.
This is the most interesting video I've ever seen about a subject I've never had a shred of interest in.\nFantastic work, Georgy-boy.
As a russian I'm very proud that you notice the Dendy and Kinamania's Documentary FIlm about that. Can you make a video about Soviet and Russian Gaming, please?
NOOOOOOOOOOOODDLLEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Trending. Nice job George!
#43 on Trending. Nice!

ZED X
Superior video
DENDY!!! T____T
Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months
>Capitalist Luxury
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
imagine the games we could create if east germany rose again\nI'd be the leader of the new gdr and I'd allow war games as long as they where through perspective of eastern countries
Your videos keep making this political scientist smile. Keep up the good work
I strongly recommend to the people who liked this video to watch the Dendy russian video about an angry russian dude (acting like the AVGN) talking about his childhood playing those NES knockoffs and ports of newer games on that nes hardware. It's very interesting and fun to watch!
When it worked.\n\nIt never worked. That's why the lines and the poverty were so different when the unification happened.
But nintendo is eastern.
So this might be an influence to why Yager made the most prolific anti-war war game to date?
I had never thought of, or even thought to think of, gaming in the Eastern Bloc.\nExcellent topic choice, and as usual, excellent video.\nThank you for this!
That museum was very cool. Really liked seeing the old games and tech.
lol, my mum didn't see a pineapple till she was 18, let alone video games
I visited the museum last year with my college class it was extremely interesting(The pain station was the center piece of our whole time there, did you play it bunny?) but they never quite went into how the machines etc. were programmed that was very interesting finding it out from this video. \nDid you manage to get to the DDR museum bunny? I found it very interesting as well.
Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
The Hudson river, two years ago...
I am glad that Marxism did not prevail in the free world.
The Stasi secret police museum is actually not very far away from the video game museum. It's 10 minutes on the train system they have there.
It's not that related to the topic at hand, but that museum is great. In there you can have a chat with one of the first chat bots called Eliza, created in the 60-s. When I was there I told it it's 2014 and it told me I'm insane.\n\nThey also have the weirdest arcade pong machine called Pain station. You move the bar by rotating an analog tumbler with your right hand, while your left hand is pressed against a metal grate with electric contacts. If you take your left hand off that grate, you lose. The gist is - every time you miss a ball, random danger zones appear on the screen. If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts. We've had enough after like 5 minutes. The record holder, as we were told, has managed to endure this for several hours.
amazing ingenuinity on part of east german programmers, even if their gaming industry never kicked off\nimagine playing western games for hours so that you can make your own copy from scratch and discussing coding with other programmers through (non-electronic) mail\nhats off to people like andre weißflog
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...
btw dendy is a chinese system and was simultaneously on market with sega16bit and ps1 (n64 and snes too but no one ever cared about nintendo)
wow this video made it into youtube's trending, well deserved in my opinion
This is also the case in all of the former soviet bloc countries. Taping software/games on cassettes in order to share them to the few people who had some sort of bootleg commodore 64 was common practice.
Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.

How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
for thanksgiving i am thankful for this channel.
That song that played at 8:51 does anyone know what it is? I keep hearing it randomly in different forms whenever I hear something USSR related...
East Germany was famous for manufacturing the world's largest microchips.
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the Денде?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
This is pure ideology.
When Clair de Lune started playing at the beginning I stated tearing up, god dammit Danganronpa V3
This is REAL games journalism. We got SUper Bunnyhop here investigating cool as shit history on videogames and digging up contact info of developers from 30+ years ago, while Kotaku just says you're sexist for playing Minecraft.
It is true the COCom list made it impossible for us as teenies to get hightech from western Europe, but these rules did not aplly to electronic scrap. Friends of mine in West Berlin sendet me vie postal service carefully seperatet/cutted parts in several packages and we buildet and soldet everything up again. :-) These C4 plus/ C-64 looked a little bit strange afterwards, but we had a working computer at the end. We were creative :-).
This is some real games journalism bruh
I live in east Germany. :) The video is very good as always.
Makes me think of the gaming history of my own country somehow - especially the ripoff part haha
MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
I got an update for you, the iron courtain doesn't exist anymore, nice bait fgt
would love to see more videos like this Georgie porgie.
In Hungary the curtain was a bit more loose, so there were zx Spectrums at schools, and also c64 and amiga smuggled from Austria. Videoton also made some pong console clones, and there was the fairly popular Yellow Cartridge Nintendo ( sárga kazettás ) clone console.\nThere's a documentary about the Commodore64 game developement called Moleman 4 - Longplay.\nAlso all those Trabants make me feel nostalgic. We had one until 2007.
1:05 I am German and I did not know that East Germany had video games at that point in time either.
ah well, the memories. As a eastern germany kid the only games I was able to play until the wall was torn down were the one in Polyplay and I loved them. Thankfully we have a Polyplay in a local bar here.
I think of all soviet block countries Poland was in best gaming shape.
As an eastern german it is nice to watch a video about this topic. It was a strange and weird time for us here. Also interesting because I visited the Computerspielmuseum this spring too and it was really interesting, absolute worth it.  Perhaps an idea for the future would be a video about the console usage in eastern europe after 89. I know here and also in brasil the Sega Master System was the dominant console for a short time. My first own console was a Sega MS II with Sonic included until I got an PSX as a birthday gift, I skipped the 16 bit era entirely. \n\nBy the way, I am not so sure that Yager Entertainment is an east german company, the buisness address is in Kreuzberg, West-Berlin. But the managing director Timo Ullmann studied at the Humbolt university, East-Berlin. Berlin not really east or west more its own thing so hard to tell. But this is not that important.
Keep in mind, that Densi dound its way to Russia after fall of USSR and was, essentially, a cheap alternative of NES, since the pric of the latter was around 2 or 3 (maybe more) montly family budgets.
That was a fantastic video! Thank you!
Please make a video about gaming in communist Poland. It's actually quite an interesting topic.
Germany was pretty fucked up at the time.\nWestern germany was pretty much enslaving eastern germany to produce a lot of products like furniture and many other things for a low price while eastern germany didn't even have acces to many of those things.\nAnd the reason why this was going on for so long is simply because western germany  only made profits while the east wasn't able to develop and fight back.\nThere are many stories out there and if you got caught trying to cross the well protected border, you were either caught and put behind bars if you were lucky or shot on the spot like a dog in the streets.\nYou also were not allowed to leave the country (GDR or DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) as we call it in germany) without permission to do so wich still was pretty restricted to say the least. \nTo this day, western germany is much more developed and has higher wages than eastern germany BUT the cost of living there is also much higher.\nIt's still pretty fucked up in my opinion and with all the new people streaming in from the southeast, the government is putting a lot of money into programs for them like learning german and everything surrounding work and stuff wich leaves germans in the dust.\nBut I guess in 3 to 5 years everything will get better once all those people got integrated into our society.\nSorry for drifting off lol
Down with communist and socialist.
Great vid George! A West-German approves.\nAnd just the right amount of Hoff - you brilliant bastard you!
Honestly getting a guided tour at the Stasi museum was the final nail in the coffin for believing communism could ever work. It's basically just one giant den of nepotism.
so let me be your token german george.....  the DDR had video games?°_°
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
This is one of many reasons as to why I do not support Socialism/Marxism
Born in the GDR in 1981, I am one of those people who suffered from the lack of video games in the early childhood. My first and only gaming experience before the fall of the iron curtain was a few minutes of River Raid (shown in this video). Even after the reunion it took me a little while (christmas 1991 to be exact) to get my first console (the SEGA Master System), because money was short for most former eastern germans and electronic was very expensive (an empty cassette tape for example costed 20 Mark which is around 40-50$ by today's standard) . For a whole year I had only Alex Kidd and Sonic to play, followed by Sonic 2 the next christmas. I'm not really sad about it because I learned to appreciate what I had instead of being jealous of what others had. It had a unique kind of fascination to try out a new game back then and that's what I'm missing today.\nAfter all I (and the former GDR in general) quickly caught up with the latest technology and by the time the fifth generation of video games (N64, Playstation, Saturn) came we were on the same level as the rest of the world, if not earlier.\nWe may have missed some precious childhood experiences back then, but we also learned to respect video games in a way most people didn't :)
And that's why I dislike communism.
Everytime governments think they've controlled markets, people make their choices anyway. This is why black markets exist.
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?
If only communism would've actually been a good way to run a country and not make everyone hate it and want to leave, because ultimately it's not in our nature to behave that way.\nI was born way past that time, but it does sound like a fucking nightmare. By the by, I never learned stuff like this in school. All we ever talked about was how bad Hitler was and nothing else, like what our country was actually like.
With people even resorting to broadcasting source code to each other over the radio... \n\nLook at what lengths these people went to make games work back then! Meanwhile publishers like 2K can't be bothered to get 2K18 under freaking 16 GB for the Switch...
The Dendy is actually a Taiwanese clone console,its just sold in Russia.
This is the most interesting video I've ever seen about a subject I've never had a shred of interest in.\nFantastic work, Georgy-boy.
NOOOOOOOOOOOODDLLEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Trending. Nice job George!
Lovely report, thank you Bunnyhop.
GEORGE on TRENDING!?

communism/socialism is cancer
Trending!!!! My boyyyy
**!GEHALTEN!**
ICH BIN EINE GAMER!
Bin ich der einzige Deutsche hier?
Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
8:08 thanks for the fan service george
This story is a jewel. I have researched the history of computing in the Warsaw Pact countries and it is wonderful to see the quality of this work. I am grateful. Thank you very much.
7 minutes in and I still don't see the point this video is trying to make...
The animations were my favourite part, Dad Gorg continues to raise the bar for everyone.
Great, informative video! In Finland, we also had commodore programs broadcast over the radio so you could record it on a cassette.
I come close from Koblenz and i wondered why i could never find a NES. gameboy. SNES or any other console/pc on a fleamarket.\nThey didn't have that shit lol.
Great video as always George. I saw a cip from  Curse of the grey elephant at 6:40, did you watched it? Because i would be interested in your thoughts about it.
I spat my drink out when he pronounced comparison , instead of comparishon*
Surely Michael Gorbachev takes some credit for the wall?
I loved the music choices in this vid. And this was a very interesting topic.
That's some great parents.
Okay, seriously, why didn't it show up in my subscription box despite me having you subbed and the bell on?
imagine the games we could create if east germany rose again\nI'd be the leader of the new gdr and I'd allow war games as long as they where through perspective of eastern countries
Your videos keep making this political scientist smile. Keep up the good work

btw dendy is a chinese system and was simultaneously on market with sega16bit and ps1 (n64 and snes too but no one ever cared about nintendo)
wow this video made it into youtube's trending, well deserved in my opinion
I strongly recommend to the people who liked this video to watch the Dendy russian video about an angry russian dude (acting like the AVGN) talking about his childhood playing those NES knockoffs and ports of newer games on that nes hardware. It's very interesting and fun to watch!
When it worked.\n\nIt never worked. That's why the lines and the poverty were so different when the unification happened.
But nintendo is eastern.
So this might be an influence to why Yager made the most prolific anti-war war game to date?
I had never thought of, or even thought to think of, gaming in the Eastern Bloc.\nExcellent topic choice, and as usual, excellent video.\nThank you for this!
That museum was very cool. Really liked seeing the old games and tech.
lol, my mum didn't see a pineapple till she was 18, let alone video games
I visited the museum last year with my college class it was extremely interesting(The pain station was the center piece of our whole time there, did you play it bunny?) but they never quite went into how the machines etc. were programmed that was very interesting finding it out from this video. \nDid you manage to get to the DDR museum bunny? I found it very interesting as well.
Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
I dig the sad Tetris theme
It is shocking that East Germany were way behind Poland (my homeland country neighboring with former East Germany) in video games field. In Poland were not produced home computers in late 80' nevertheless they were imported from West Germany (Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and later Amiga). At these times on flea markets you could get many games (of course pirated but back then in Poland were not defined anti-piracy law) therefore we could play many different games from the west. In Poland video game consoles became popular in early 90' when communism was overthrown and one of Polish company imported Taiwan famiclones (Famicom/NES clone) known today as Pegasus. To be honest I miss these days, it was really good times.
It depresses me to know that my parents and other relatives back in Romania had to live and grow up under these conditions and I only narrowly avoided being born under Communism.
But games aren't political though.
What is this? WHAT IS THIS!?? An American talking about something from beyond the Iron Curtain? And doing proper research on it? And presenting it in a bearable manner? my compliments go to that!\n\nWhen I clicked on the video I seriously expected it will be all like HUHUH, they didnt have NENTENDUH, HUHUH, they suck!
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?
The Hudson river, two years ago...
This is also the case in all of the former soviet bloc countries. Taping software/games on cassettes in order to share them to the few people who had some sort of bootleg commodore 64 was common practice.
I am glad that Marxism did not prevail in the free world.
The Stasi secret police museum is actually not very far away from the video game museum. It's 10 minutes on the train system they have there.
It's not that related to the topic at hand, but that museum is great. In there you can have a chat with one of the first chat bots called Eliza, created in the 60-s. When I was there I told it it's 2014 and it told me I'm insane.\n\nThey also have the weirdest arcade pong machine called Pain station. You move the bar by rotating an analog tumbler with your right hand, while your left hand is pressed against a metal grate with electric contacts. If you take your left hand off that grate, you lose. The gist is - every time you miss a ball, random danger zones appear on the screen. If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts. We've had enough after like 5 minutes. The record holder, as we were told, has managed to endure this for several hours.
amazing ingenuinity on part of east german programmers, even if their gaming industry never kicked off\nimagine playing western games for hours so that you can make your own copy from scratch and discussing coding with other programmers through (non-electronic) mail\nhats off to people like andre weißflog
Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.
1:06 I live in berlin and never knew about this sooooo....yeah ;)
Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.

MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...

Do .smc roms work?
Legend.
I just lost my audio in the main menu need help.
thanks man. SUPER EASY GUYS! follow instructions and you're good.
Anyone else experiencing delay in sound response since having added games?
Anyone have a link to the oem kernel dump? I missed that step and I need to flash back to original
Just wanna say thank you Eta Prime for the amazing videos and this tutorial. Got my roms and followed your tutorial step by step and my SNES now has 72 of my all time fav. Games. So thank you again and well done sir.
Will n64 roms work with this?
I can’t wait to try this. If I had one..
256Mb flash on the board? wow nintendo really knows how to lowball its consumers.
What's up guy join this channel @bebeandjay00 to have a chance at winning NES classic for free
The mod worked perfectly and I executed it four consecutive times! Thanks again, ETA PRIME!
Whenever I press L+R+Start+Select it just resets the game. It doesn't take me to the hub. Perhaps when you flash it, it adds that feature. Normally it does not work in that fashion. Which is why they are pushing those Wii controllers for the extra Home Button.
How do you add more game? Do you have to do the power reset thing? Could you make a video of adding more.
Do you have to dump the kernal every time you add more games??????
can i use any rom files for the snes?
keep getting cant write to usb
nice
Amazing
Page not found :(
Are EU Version working? Or just the US versions?
So I tried to put battletoads battlemania but it doesn't seem to want work whenever I click on the game it just resets can anyone tell me why? Does anyone else have this issue?
What safe websites can I go on to download games to do all of this? I don't want to get in trouble for downloading roms if it's illegal.
does not work on europe :(
Aside from Chrono Trigger every rpg lover should add Lufia 2 to the snes mini, great game! Also does/will this run patched translated roms like Star Ocean and Seiken Densetsu 3?
I have 91 working right now except they demand to be in a other games folder in the SNES mini with the original 21 showing. I have to go into other games and I can play any of them. I changed the limit to 100 assuming that'd fix the folder issue but oh well it works!\nedit: fixed, forgot to select pages split games equally superb.+
added about 80 games to mine. all work except mario all stars. unsure why.
So if I want to keep the original 21 games, do I have to download those ROMs as well? Or do the new games just get added to the original 21?
Hey man thanks for the video it was very helpful!
I get Nes Mini not found, sorry when I click install driver, following your directions at the dump kernel step. Tried all my usb ports (they are all 3.0), tried stock cable, and other cables to make sure it wasn't cable. I'm on windows 10.
Works great!! Someone help me find Super Mario All stars and Donkey Country 2 diddy kong. Thanks

Always such clear helpful videos. What a legend!
Hi guys. All works great, but the only niggle is that some of the games have downloaded with spelling errors in the title box. For example, earthworm jim is showing as eartworm im. Has anyone else had this, and how do you rectifty it? thanks guys.
I'm CONSTANTLY getting the error Kernel dumped but the MDS checksum is unknown: f1c07be36baad573d7bc17bc8be22cfa Do you want to continue? I hit yes, and get the same error when flashing the custom kernel and no additional games ever show up. What gives?
Thank you very much my friend, worked fantastic.
Can't get super street fighter 2 to work or alpha
I was waiting for a video like this :)
Thanks, ETA PRIME! I have followed your tutorials for the NES Classic Hakchi and this new SNES Hakchi... They are superb and you make it so simple to follow your instructions. Thank you very much!
SO I have the EU version of the SNES will it work?
The driver keeps saying nes mini not found, sorry. How do I solve this?
I've used the RC4 version (works great) but is it worth using the Hakchi 2.0 official version? Or continue using the debug version?
Do i need to install RC4 or does it come internally with ver2.20?
Wish somebody would make full,and good scrapers
I followed your video perfectly, added about 100 games and was checking them out and testing some. I made a save state in Chrono Trigger and when I turned off the mini I got a C8 error :(\nany idea how to fix it?
Is it worth hacking my SNES Classic if I can already hack my NES Classic? Are the graphics any better or anything like that?
Is there a difference in performance between compressed zips and uncompressed .smc files?
Thank you for this, I modded my mini using this tutorial for the 2.20 HackChi and it worked great. Just a word of advice, the first time you load the new kernal on your tv, it will take a bit of time for it to load up.
Where do I get the ROMS?
can we put nes titles on the snes mini?
Thank God people who hold her views are in the minority.
Great stuff! Most of my additions worked perfectly! Of my original 13, however, three of them had issues and failed in one way or another (Illusion of Gaia got to the start screen with no sound, then froze. Terranigma played but the sound was completely gone save for a random jump noise. Tales of Phantasia completely refused to load and froze before anything popped up.) \n\nMy question: When putting new versions on there, do I have to uninstall those previous ones? Or do I just replace them with the new roms?
Any way to make this work on a Mac
does it make a difference if they are in sfc or smc format?
Does this method erase saved games?
Can someone post a zip of the ROMs along with the box art, and metadata like 1P/2P, supports save, release dates, etc, like someone did for the NES Classic ETA video?
Does retroarch work on the snes as well? I'm interested in putting some gameboy advance roms on it..
wow all i need now is the console
Perfect.  Thank you for this.
Okay, I’m new to this, ive tried (3) Times and I’m only seeing the original games...  are all of my Roms bad?
NTSC-J games work as well, even some english patched ones I tried. However, the NTSC-U rom of Super Street Fighter 2 that I have doesn't boot. The system throws up an error.
@Eta Prime link for the RC is down? Any other link available?
This has been what i've been waiting for.  You are my HERO!
what about running different emulators gbc/gba Sega??
I cant find a working rc4 link
Could anyone please share the RC4 file?  The link isnt working.
Goldeneye 007 next year? Will Nintendo create a Rom where Goldeneye runs perfect on their N64 Classic?
Also the link is 404'd now!
site seems to be down i hope this is only temporary and not a DMCA shutdown or a cease and desist
This is great. Thanks for these videos.
I...I can't believe it. IT WORKED FIRST TRY! This walkthrough was PERFECT. You spoke clearly, repeated necessary information and were very specific throughout the entire video. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
If you wind up bricking your console, you can likely reflash it and get back to gaming
So roms are running on the SNES classic’s own emulator? Or how is this working?
I love watching your videos dude. You are very straight to the point with your tutorials.
Finally cracked it, re-flashed with original kernel.\ndeleted hakchi and re-downloaded.\nrepeated same process I've already done.\nworked a treat
Got about a 100 games on and quite a few have audio issues, just wondering if we should untick compression as they are already rared
L R Start Select is the old Squaresoft code for soft resetting their RPGs.
Is there any risk in doing this on the European SNES mini guys?
I'll wait until the official release because I  do not wanna damage my super Mario RPG &yoshi island files
so I have a question, do we have to go through the same process everytime we want to add more games? thank you for the tutorial worked like a charm!
the link for RC4 download is dead :(
When I dump the kernel it gives me MD5 checksum message.  I'm missing a step?
What format Roms are people using? I have SMC and SFC.
does doing this affect ur save files in the original 21 games???
When I turn mine off I get a C8 error
I'm trying this on a UK SNES Mini with US ROMS.  All seems to work fine with Hakchi but the new games don't show when I power it up, only the original 21.  I have tried a couple of different folder formats but no luck.  Any ideas anyone?
will dump kernal overwrite the NES Mini Kernal I have previously dumped?
It works, it's awesome, the weird thing I get is that if I turn off the snes mini at the menu screen I get a c8 error...but if I turn it off during a game....it turns off fine. Reflashed original, flashed custom, tried it again and still get c8 error. Works for me, which is great, still but minor nuisance.
This may be a dumb question, but is it possible to do all of this using a mac? Or is it only doable on PC?
Where do you plug into the SNES? Like what cable is necessary to connect from the computer to the console?
Please note (best to my knowledge) that the EU PAL edition of the SNES Mini also came with USA installed games. There are no EU Pal games on the system. I guess thats because the EU games ran at 50hz and had those letterbox borders on them.
Will this allow you to add NES games to the SNES as well?
Hey\nI have a very important question. How the f... do i save my game progress for my extra added games, without using the suspend point option? I can't save my progress on the cartridge (rom)? Can we fix that somehow?
Might this be possible, install snes classic kernel?\n convert my mini Classic  NES OS to Snes mini Classic OS
The link no longer exist
Hey I already have a NES Classic with hakchi2, is there any point for me pick up a SNES Classic? I'm honestly just curious sense I heard that they supposedly have the exact same hardware.
Followed Directions to a T here.  No games are popping up in menu.  Even after selecting (pages, split games equally) No gray folder either.  Just the same setup as I had.  Holding RL Start and Select only resets the game as well.\n  ANY IDEAS?
does this remove progress from my snes? I have about 10 hours into ff3. also during the initial plug in flash where it tells you to install driver, should I install driver after doing all the previous steps?
Thank you ETA Prime! I have been looking forward to adding about 6-8 more games to mine. \nQuestion can anyone confirm this method keeps using the original SNES emulator (Canoe?). I was not interested in installing RetroArch or anything since we already have a Pi for that. The SNES Mini seems to emulate the games it has more accurately (less lag) and I would like to use it for other games If possible
Official 2.20 HackChi !!!!\nhttps://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2/releases/
Not feeling that 3D boxart. Pic is too skewed. Looks like when self publishing authors use that program to make their ebook cover to look like a physical hard cover book.  Not a criticism of ETA, just expressing an opinion. Thanks for the upload.
I bricked mine dammit! Just kiddin works great so far.
nice  my dream love to see KILLER INSTINCT  arcade on  snes mini
So roms are running on the SNES classic’s own emulator? Or how is this working?
Works a treat, I was a bit sceptical at first, and was caught in 2 minds when it came to flashing the Kernel etc, but I got it to work! A brilliant tutorial, thanks. Anyone who's unsure, take it from me. If you follow exactly what's being said; you'll be chuffed.
Got about a 100 games on and quite a few have audio issues, just wondering if we should untick compression as they are already rared
Just added 20 games, they all work perfectly, adding them didn't erase your previous save points, some games like earthworm Jim 1-2 and chronic trigger reset the game when you press L+R+Sel+start, so if you want to make a save point make sure you hit the reset switch on the console, if you press the controller buttons you are gonna reset the game and the save point will only be a reseted game and one last thing if you choose to display te games on the menu, the little thumbnails will only fit 31 games, you can see them on the big thumbnail bit not on the little one on the bottom (the little stripe with all the thumbnails)
Just picked my favs thanks for the tut
My curated game list is ~80 games and even that is a little much I think. I could probably cut it down to 60 roms that I love. Thanks for the videos on the SNES classic.
can't dump kernel
Do .smc roms work?
I did all of the steps from the video. But when I go to use my SNES Classic it's the stock UI with the original 21 games. No folder contain extra games I just added
@ETA Prime.. congrats long time sub jere. You made it on the trending page with this vid.
Hello and thank you for the work\nI'm currently trying to do it on my NES Mini (not SNES) (Hakchi2.21b), but here is what I receive as a message after dumping the kernel and clicking Continue to upload games.\n\nshell command tar -xvC/var/lib/hakchi/rootfs/usr/share/games/nes/kachikachi returned exit code 1:tar: can't change directory to 'var/lib/hakchi/rootfs/usr/share/games/nes/kachikachi': No such file or directory\n\nI'm on WIndows 10\n\nThanks for the help
Legend.
Yeah... I dont like the 3D boxes for this...
keep getting cant write to usb
Dumb Question,  For UK Super NES do I pick SNES or Super Famicom.
Thanks you saved me
thank you
How do I add Raspian? Lmao, j/k
When doing my one, I found when using USB 2 the Mini kept disconnecting from my PC (right in  the middle of dumping the rom) ...Maybe not enough power...So I tried the USB 3 port and that stopped the problem.  Lucky it weren't flashing the Kernel. Other than that 2.20 seems to work 100%
thanks man. SUPER EASY GUYS! follow instructions and you're good.
Anyone else experiencing delay in sound response since having added games?
I just lost my audio in the main menu need help.
Anyone have a link to the oem kernel dump? I missed that step and I need to flash back to original
Just wanna say thank you Eta Prime for the amazing videos and this tutorial. Got my roms and followed your tutorial step by step and my SNES now has 72 of my all time fav. Games. So thank you again and well done sir.
I can’t wait to try this. If I had one..
256Mb flash on the board? wow nintendo really knows how to lowball its consumers.
What's up guy join this channel @bebeandjay00 to have a chance at winning NES classic for free
Whenever I press L+R+Start+Select it just resets the game. It doesn't take me to the hub. Perhaps when you flash it, it adds that feature. Normally it does not work in that fashion. Which is why they are pushing those Wii controllers for the extra Home Button.
How do you add more game? Do you have to do the power reset thing? Could you make a video of adding more.
Do you have to dump the kernal every time you add more games??????
can i use any rom files for the snes?
So I tried to put battletoads battlemania but it doesn't seem to want work whenever I click on the game it just resets can anyone tell me why? Does anyone else have this issue?
What safe websites can I go on to download games to do all of this? I don't want to get in trouble for downloading roms if it's illegal.
how about if i cannot install the driver?\nwindows 10 i get the message that nes not found
does not work on europe :(
Aside from Chrono Trigger every rpg lover should add Lufia 2 to the snes mini, great game! Also does/will this run patched translated roms like Star Ocean and Seiken Densetsu 3?
The mod worked perfectly and I executed it four consecutive times! Thanks again, ETA PRIME!
Are EU Version working? Or just the US versions?
I have 91 working right now except they demand to be in a other games folder in the SNES mini with the original 21 showing. I have to go into other games and I can play any of them. I changed the limit to 100 assuming that'd fix the folder issue but oh well it works!\nedit: fixed, forgot to select pages split games equally superb.+
added about 80 games to mine. all work except mario all stars. unsure why.
So if I want to keep the original 21 games, do I have to download those ROMs as well? Or do the new games just get added to the original 21?
I get Nes Mini not found, sorry when I click install driver, following your directions at the dump kernel step. Tried all my usb ports (they are all 3.0), tried stock cable, and other cables to make sure it wasn't cable. I'm on windows 10.
Hey man thanks for the video it was very helpful!
Works great!! Someone help me find Super Mario All stars and Donkey Country 2 diddy kong. Thanks

Always such clear helpful videos. What a legend!
Hi guys. All works great, but the only niggle is that some of the games have downloaded with spelling errors in the title box. For example, earthworm jim is showing as eartworm im. Has anyone else had this, and how do you rectifty it? thanks guys.
Thank you very much my friend, worked fantastic.
Can't get super street fighter 2 to work or alpha
I was waiting for a video like this :)
SO I have the EU version of the SNES will it work?
Wish somebody would make full,and good scrapers
can we put nes titles on the snes mini?
Great video waiting for final version
Can someone post a zip of the ROMs along with the box art, and metadata like 1P/2P, supports save, release dates, etc, like someone did for the NES Classic ETA video?
Does retroarch work on the snes as well? I'm interested in putting some gameboy advance roms on it..
NTSC-J games work as well, even some english patched ones I tried. However, the NTSC-U rom of Super Street Fighter 2 that I have doesn't boot. The system throws up an error.
@Eta Prime link for the RC is down? Any other link available?
Could anyone please share the RC4 file?  The link isnt working.
So is this using the official emulator or is a 3rd party one being used?
Does this keep the save states I still have  if I leave “original games” on?
Thanks for showing. I'll wait for the Pal version.
Would we be able to add NES games in parallel to SNES games?
Man I Watch all your videos love them very helpful and freaking amazing also I ordered that snes classic shell for a pi lol I wish there was a super famicom one to but oh well side note I did preorder the Japanese famicom classic super and the European versions so I’ll be getting them soon so excited bro keep going!!!
best games to add?
I knew it wouldn't take long before this thing got hacked. It had all the same internals as the NES Classic. Fun stuff
Thanks ETA - Stunt Race FX here I come!
Can you put nes games on there too?
Any way to make this work on a Mac
I love watching your videos dude. You are very straight to the point with your tutorials.
Finally cracked it, re-flashed with original kernel.\ndeleted hakchi and re-downloaded.\nrepeated same process I've already done.\nworked a treat
Works perfect!! I now have over 40 games and still adding more to my snes mini awesome vid thanx for the info !!
I live in Europe. What should i select SNES Classic or Super Famicom Classic?
I don't like the box art
Can you also put NES games on it?
I'll wait until the official release because I  do not wanna damage my super Mario RPG &yoshi island files
Is there any risk in doing this on the European SNES mini guys?
i would like to convert my mini Classic  NES OS to Snes mini Classic OS.
so I have a question, do we have to go through the same process everytime we want to add more games? thank you for the tutorial worked like a charm!
I noticed Hakchi 2 you used here gave you the option of selecting the NES mini. Could you use this same process to add SNES games to an NES mini? I was lucky enough to get the NES mini, but the SNES is proving to be more difficult lol
Hey\nI have a very important question. How the f... do i save my game progress for my extra added games, without using the suspend point option? I can't save my progress on the cartridge (rom)? Can we fix that somehow?
the link for RC4 download is dead :(
Will n64 roms work with this?
I'm CONSTANTLY getting the error Kernel dumped but the MDS checksum is unknown: f1c07be36baad573d7bc17bc8be22cfa Do you want to continue? I hit yes, and get the same error when flashing the custom kernel and no additional games ever show up. What gives?
This may be a dumb question, but is it possible to do all of this using a mac? Or is it only doable on PC?
somehow, none of the links work, and the one on clusters page says that error 404 no found
Can't do it if you don't have one!
Thank you for the tutorial. Now I can add my favourite games just  like I did with your NES vid.
does doing this affect ur save files in the original 21 games???
Tried 3 times, games on system but not showing on Menu
Where do you plug into the SNES? Like what cable is necessary to connect from the computer to the console?
It works, it's awesome, the weird thing I get is that if I turn off the snes mini at the menu screen I get a c8 error...but if I turn it off during a game....it turns off fine.

Please note (best to my knowledge) that the EU PAL edition of the SNES Mini also came with USA installed games. There are no EU Pal games on the system. I guess thats because the EU games ran at 50hz and had those letterbox borders on them.
Will I lose my current saves or does it keep the original games and saves when adding new ones?
Hello i have a PAL Console can i use PAL Roms? or i have to convert to NTSC
L, R, Start, Select is supposed to reset the game. I guess hakchi modified this original behaviour.
hahahaha... that was just plain mean.. funny shit though...
It's easy to laugh when they have no idea of the context. When Nintendo released the NES Classic, many stores were only given about 4 or so and then they never got any more. Most of them ended up being bought by scalpers who wanted to turn a profit, meaning a tremendous amount of people who wanted the system never got the chance to buy one, especially after Nintendo announced they were cancelling their run of the system. It's only natural to assume the same would happen here seeing as that's just how Nintendo has been running their ship for a while now, so can you really blame these two for waiting for hours to make absolute certain they got the thing they wanted?
someone explain how this is trending?
they can laugh all they want but if the news chick wanted a limited edition COACH purse she be waiting in line or the male anchor  same thing just a limited edition doll for kids for his daughter or grand daughter he be in line also. yet when it comes to a console hahahahaha besides this year for the  latest iphone not the X but the 8 no lines yet this November  their will be lines for it yet no one will be laughing  yet i think waiting for a console is more worth it  rather than a damn phone.
Fox news... lmaoo
oh man--  i keep reviewing this-- hillarious well hhmm so i saw 6 or so games that would be fun to play and replay most ive never played before so ya sorry nintendo  if i was to egt a snes id like to play  5-6 gameso n this system true and some other oens i liked that arnt included on this version heres to a snes mini 2

Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.
1:06 I live in berlin and never knew about this sooooo....yeah ;)
Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
This video infuriates me so much!\n\nHey, lets make a video about gaming in the Soviet Bloc. Obvious choice are the countries in the former Soviet Union, but nah, F those Ruskies. How about Bulgaria or Romania, countries  outside what most Westerners consider the Soviet Bloc? You just answered your own question! How about Yugoslavia, a sui generis country with a Marxist-Leninist ideology but outside the Soviet Bloc? Who cares about those losers? OK, lets focus on East Germany, a geopolitical region that outside of 50-some-odd years of communist rule in nonetheless an integral part of Western Civilization? Bingo!
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.
Dude, you really have a lot of talent. As cliche as it sounds, this really has a lot of meaning in the scientific community as it stands in america. The government holding back its citizens in scientific discovery is mind boggling.
Thats a new subject matter. DANKA  I am makeing subscrib to wonderful YouTubes channel.
How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the Денде?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
This is pure ideology.
When Clair de Lune started playing at the beginning I stated tearing up, god dammit Danganronpa V3
This is REAL games journalism. We got SUper Bunnyhop here investigating cool as shit history on videogames and digging up contact info of developers from 30+ years ago, while Kotaku just says you're sexist for playing Minecraft.
It is true the COCom list made it impossible for us as teenies to get hightech from western Europe, but these rules did not aplly to electronic scrap. Friends of mine in West Berlin sendet me vie postal service carefully seperatet/cutted parts in several packages and we buildet and soldet everything up again. :-) These C4 plus/ C-64 looked a little bit strange afterwards, but we had a working computer at the end. We were creative :-).
This is some real games journalism bruh
I live in east Germany. :) The video is very good as always.
Makes me think of the gaming history of my own country somehow - especially the ripoff part haha
MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
I got an update for you, the iron courtain doesn't exist anymore, nice bait fgt
would love to see more videos like this Georgie porgie.
In Hungary the curtain was a bit more loose, so there were zx Spectrums at schools, and also c64 and amiga smuggled from Austria. Videoton also made some pong console clones, and there was the fairly popular Yellow Cartridge Nintendo ( sárga kazettás ) clone console.\nThere's a documentary about the Commodore64 game developement called Moleman 4 - Longplay.\nAlso all those Trabants make me feel nostalgic. We had one until 2007.
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
1:05 I am German and I did not know that East Germany had video games at that point in time either.
ah well, the memories. As a eastern germany kid the only games I was able to play until the wall was torn down were the one in Polyplay and I loved them. Thankfully we have a Polyplay in a local bar here.
I think of all soviet block countries Poland was in best gaming shape.
As an eastern german it is nice to watch a video about this topic. It was a strange and weird time for us here. Also interesting because I visited the Computerspielmuseum this spring too and it was really interesting, absolute worth it.  Perhaps an idea for the future would be a video about the console usage in eastern europe after 89. I know here and also in brasil the Sega Master System was the dominant console for a short time. My first own console was a Sega MS II with Sonic included until I got an PSX as a birthday gift, I skipped the 16 bit era entirely. \n\nBy the way, I am not so sure that Yager Entertainment is an east german company, the buisness address is in Kreuzberg, West-Berlin. But the managing director Timo Ullmann studied at the Humbolt university, East-Berlin. Berlin not really east or west more its own thing so hard to tell. But this is not that important.
Keep in mind, that Densi dound its way to Russia after fall of USSR and was, essentially, a cheap alternative of NES, since the pric of the latter was around 2 or 3 (maybe more) montly family budgets.
That was a fantastic video! Thank you!
Please make a video about gaming in communist Poland. It's actually quite an interesting topic.
Germany was pretty fucked up at the time.\nWestern germany was pretty much enslaving eastern germany to produce a lot of products like furniture and many other things for a low price while eastern germany didn't even have acces to many of those things.\nAnd the reason why this was going on for so long is simply because western germany  only made profits while the east wasn't able to develop and fight back.\nThere are many stories out there and if you got caught trying to cross the well protected border, you were either caught and put behind bars if you were lucky or shot on the spot like a dog in the streets.\nYou also were not allowed to leave the country (GDR or DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) as we call it in germany) without permission to do so wich still was pretty restricted to say the least. \nTo this day, western germany is much more developed and has higher wages than eastern germany BUT the cost of living there is also much higher.\nIt's still pretty fucked up in my opinion and with all the new people streaming in from the southeast, the government is putting a lot of money into programs for them like learning german and everything surrounding work and stuff wich leaves germans in the dust.\nBut I guess in 3 to 5 years everything will get better once all those people got integrated into our society.\nSorry for drifting off lol
Down with communist and socialist.
Great vid George! A West-German approves.\nAnd just the right amount of Hoff - you brilliant bastard you!
Honestly getting a guided tour at the Stasi museum was the final nail in the coffin for believing communism could ever work. It's basically just one giant den of nepotism.
so let me be your token german george.....  the DDR had video games?°_°
East Germany was famous for manufacturing the world's largest microchips.
for thanksgiving i am thankful for this channel.
That song that played at 8:51 does anyone know what it is? I keep hearing it randomly in different forms whenever I hear something USSR related...
Vinyl records were once  used to store computer data????? I honestly didnt know that was possible. Fascinating.
Fantastic video as always George! Thanks :)
danm, this is great. Thanks George!
Impressive work George, well done!
This is so interesting, thank you!
I visited that museum last year and they've got a lot of interesting things in there. Berlin is a fantastic destination in general. The food, beer and nightclubbing are next level.
Good Video. And i thank our capitalistic comrades (Patreons) to make this available to the working class. (And that it didn't took 5 years trto make. Comrad Georg is such an overachiever)
The biggest praise I can give you as a colleague doing political journalism in Denmark is that you are perhaps the only actual games journalist. As in, you do a story, choose an angle, do actual research, interviews, sort through prior work in the area, work the story and piece together something original and enlightening. All the while tackling each subject and game with an adult eye for balance, history and nuance... well, except for when you talk about MGS, maybe ;)\n\nThe fact that you have an education while most of your contemporary colleagues are basically amateur bloggers really shines through.\n\nKudos, man. It's a joke that you're not looked on as an obvious main inspiration for the genre of video game journalism.
this was a really well done and interesting video article.  Good Job George, and thank you for the content you put out.
The GDR was actually called the DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) in German.\n\nPretty big missed opportunity for a joke there George.
that elephant is trespassing on mario world 1-2. tsk
Thank you George! Very interesting and informative, and one of those things you never know you wanted to know until you find out about it
I always freaking forget:\nWhat's the name of the piano piece at the start of the video?
sure. first thing you make when you get your hands on a cpu is a game. then some work for the socialist threadmill
Regan was more responsible for it than any other individual person...don't know why you would add that little text.
Man, what an interesting video.
Poor east german kids didn't have a nes, poor latvian kids didn't have a potato.
This is not interesting. Enough 'travel logs' Herodotus
As someone who lived in the region that was formerly known as 'West Germany' (lived pretty close to the French Border, as a matter of fact) for 10 years, I actually find it interesting to learn about what was going on in the Eastern half since I never got to go anywhere near the former GDR in my lifetime. I find it amazing how East Germans were able to improvise on how they got their video games and such. \n\nIt's still a shame that you could still feel the effects of this to this very day.
Absolutely fascinating. Love hearing history about the Cold War.
Noodles Man, aren't Germany's kid stories more gory than these games?
The Dendy is actually a Taiwanese clone console,its just sold in Russia.
This is the most interesting video I've ever seen about a subject I've never had a shred of interest in.\nFantastic work, Georgy-boy.
As a russian I'm very proud that you notice the Dendy and Kinamania's Documentary FIlm about that. Can you make a video about Soviet and Russian Gaming, please?
NOOOOOOOOOOOODDLLEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Trending. Nice job George!
#43 on Trending. Nice!
Karl Marx Ave. ah Soviet Union

Lovely report, thank you Bunnyhop.
heheh the mgs3 beginning.
Fascinating
boy gaming in commieland sure sounds great!
ZED X
Superior video
DENDY!!! T____T
Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months
>Capitalist Luxury
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
imagine the games we could create if east germany rose again\nI'd be the leader of the new gdr and I'd allow war games as long as they where through perspective of eastern countries
Your videos keep making this political scientist smile. Keep up the good work
I strongly recommend to the people who liked this video to watch the Dendy russian video about an angry russian dude (acting like the AVGN) talking about his childhood playing those NES knockoffs and ports of newer games on that nes hardware. It's very interesting and fun to watch!
When it worked.\n\nIt never worked. That's why the lines and the poverty were so different when the unification happened.
But nintendo is eastern.
So this might be an influence to why Yager made the most prolific anti-war war game to date?
I had never thought of, or even thought to think of, gaming in the Eastern Bloc.\nExcellent topic choice, and as usual, excellent video.\nThank you for this!
That museum was very cool. Really liked seeing the old games and tech.
lol, my mum didn't see a pineapple till she was 18, let alone video games
I visited the museum last year with my college class it was extremely interesting(The pain station was the center piece of our whole time there, did you play it bunny?) but they never quite went into how the machines etc. were programmed that was very interesting finding it out from this video. \nDid you manage to get to the DDR museum bunny? I found it very interesting as well.
Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
The Hudson river, two years ago...
I am glad that Marxism did not prevail in the free world.
The Stasi secret police museum is actually not very far away from the video game museum. It's 10 minutes on the train system they have there.
It's not that related to the topic at hand, but that museum is great. In there you can have a chat with one of the first chat bots called Eliza, created in the 60-s. When I was there I told it it's 2014 and it told me I'm insane.\n\nThey also have the weirdest arcade pong machine called Pain station. You move the bar by rotating an analog tumbler with your right hand, while your left hand is pressed against a metal grate with electric contacts. If you take your left hand off that grate, you lose. The gist is - every time you miss a ball, random danger zones appear on the screen. If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts. We've had enough after like 5 minutes. The record holder, as we were told, has managed to endure this for several hours.
amazing ingenuinity on part of east german programmers, even if their gaming industry never kicked off\nimagine playing western games for hours so that you can make your own copy from scratch and discussing coding with other programmers through (non-electronic) mail\nhats off to people like andre weißflog
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...
btw dendy is a chinese system and was simultaneously on market with sega16bit and ps1 (n64 and snes too but no one ever cared about nintendo)
wow this video made it into youtube's trending, well deserved in my opinion
This is also the case in all of the former soviet bloc countries. Taping software/games on cassettes in order to share them to the few people who had some sort of bootleg commodore 64 was common practice.
Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.
1:06 I live in berlin and never knew about this sooooo....yeah ;)
Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
This video infuriates me so much!\n\nHey, lets make a video about gaming in the Soviet Bloc. Obvious choice are the countries in the former Soviet Union, but nah, F those Ruskies. How about Bulgaria or Romania, countries  outside what most Westerners consider the Soviet Bloc? You just answered your own question! How about Yugoslavia, a sui generis country with a Marxist-Leninist ideology but outside the Soviet Bloc? Who cares about those losers? OK, lets focus on East Germany, a geopolitical region that outside of 50-some-odd years of communist rule in nonetheless an integral part of Western Civilization? Bingo!
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.
Dude, you really have a lot of talent. As cliche as it sounds, this really has a lot of meaning in the scientific community as it stands in america. The government holding back its citizens in scientific discovery is mind boggling.
Thats a new subject matter. DANKA  I am makeing subscrib to wonderful YouTubes channel.
How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
for thanksgiving i am thankful for this channel.
That song that played at 8:51 does anyone know what it is? I keep hearing it randomly in different forms whenever I hear something USSR related...
East Germany was famous for manufacturing the world's largest microchips.
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the Денде?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
This is pure ideology.
When Clair de Lune started playing at the beginning I stated tearing up, god dammit Danganronpa V3
This is REAL games journalism. We got SUper Bunnyhop here investigating cool as shit history on videogames and digging up contact info of developers from 30+ years ago, while Kotaku just says you're sexist for playing Minecraft.
It is true the COCom list made it impossible for us as teenies to get hightech from western Europe, but these rules did not aplly to electronic scrap. Friends of mine in West Berlin sendet me vie postal service carefully seperatet/cutted parts in several packages and we buildet and soldet everything up again. :-) These C4 plus/ C-64 looked a little bit strange afterwards, but we had a working computer at the end. We were creative :-).
This is some real games journalism bruh
I live in east Germany. :) The video is very good as always.
Makes me think of the gaming history of my own country somehow - especially the ripoff part haha
MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
I got an update for you, the iron courtain doesn't exist anymore, nice bait fgt
would love to see more videos like this Georgie porgie.
In Hungary the curtain was a bit more loose, so there were zx Spectrums at schools, and also c64 and amiga smuggled from Austria. Videoton also made some pong console clones, and there was the fairly popular Yellow Cartridge Nintendo ( sárga kazettás ) clone console.\nThere's a documentary about the Commodore64 game developement called Moleman 4 - Longplay.\nAlso all those Trabants make me feel nostalgic. We had one until 2007.
1:05 I am German and I did not know that East Germany had video games at that point in time either.
ah well, the memories. As a eastern germany kid the only games I was able to play until the wall was torn down were the one in Polyplay and I loved them. Thankfully we have a Polyplay in a local bar here.
I think of all soviet block countries Poland was in best gaming shape.
As an eastern german it is nice to watch a video about this topic. It was a strange and weird time for us here. Also interesting because I visited the Computerspielmuseum this spring too and it was really interesting, absolute worth it.  Perhaps an idea for the future would be a video about the console usage in eastern europe after 89. I know here and also in brasil the Sega Master System was the dominant console for a short time. My first own console was a Sega MS II with Sonic included until I got an PSX as a birthday gift, I skipped the 16 bit era entirely. \n\nBy the way, I am not so sure that Yager Entertainment is an east german company, the buisness address is in Kreuzberg, West-Berlin. But the managing director Timo Ullmann studied at the Humbolt university, East-Berlin. Berlin not really east or west more its own thing so hard to tell. But this is not that important.
Keep in mind, that Densi dound its way to Russia after fall of USSR and was, essentially, a cheap alternative of NES, since the pric of the latter was around 2 or 3 (maybe more) montly family budgets.
That was a fantastic video! Thank you!

Great vid George! A West-German approves.\nAnd just the right amount of Hoff - you brilliant bastard you!
Honestly getting a guided tour at the Stasi museum was the final nail in the coffin for believing communism could ever work. It's basically just one giant den of nepotism.
so let me be your token german george.....  the DDR had video games?°_°
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
This is one of many reasons as to why I do not support Socialism/Marxism
Born in the GDR in 1981, I am one of those people who suffered from the lack of video games in the early childhood. My first and only gaming experience before the fall of the iron curtain was a few minutes of River Raid (shown in this video). Even after the reunion it took me a little while (christmas 1991 to be exact) to get my first console (the SEGA Master System), because money was short for most former eastern germans and electronic was very expensive (an empty cassette tape for example costed 20 Mark which is around 40-50$ by today's standard) . For a whole year I had only Alex Kidd and Sonic to play, followed by Sonic 2 the next christmas. I'm not really sad about it because I learned to appreciate what I had instead of being jealous of what others had. It had a unique kind of fascination to try out a new game back then and that's what I'm missing today.\nAfter all I (and the former GDR in general) quickly caught up with the latest technology and by the time the fifth generation of video games (N64, Playstation, Saturn) came we were on the same level as the rest of the world, if not earlier.\nWe may have missed some precious childhood experiences back then, but we also learned to respect video games in a way most people didn't :)
And that's why I dislike communism.
Everytime governments think they've controlled markets, people make their choices anyway. This is why black markets exist.
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?
If only communism would've actually been a good way to run a country and not make everyone hate it and want to leave, because ultimately it's not in our nature to behave that way.\nI was born way past that time, but it does sound like a fucking nightmare. By the by, I never learned stuff like this in school. All we ever talked about was how bad Hitler was and nothing else, like what our country was actually like.
With people even resorting to broadcasting source code to each other over the radio... \n\nLook at what lengths these people went to make games work back then! Meanwhile publishers like 2K can't be bothered to get 2K18 under freaking 16 GB for the Switch...
The Dendy is actually a Taiwanese clone console,its just sold in Russia.
This is the most interesting video I've ever seen about a subject I've never had a shred of interest in.\nFantastic work, Georgy-boy.

This story is a jewel. I have researched the history of computing in the Warsaw Pact countries and it is wonderful to see the quality of this work. I am grateful. Thank you very much.
7 minutes in and I still don't see the point this video is trying to make...
The animations were my favourite part, Dad Gorg continues to raise the bar for everyone.
Great, informative video! In Finland, we also had commodore programs broadcast over the radio so you could record it on a cassette.
I come close from Koblenz and i wondered why i could never find a NES. gameboy. SNES or any other console/pc on a fleamarket.\nThey didn't have that shit lol.
Great video as always George. I saw a cip from  Curse of the grey elephant at 6:40, did you watched it? Because i would be interested in your thoughts about it.
I spat my drink out when he pronounced comparison , instead of comparishon*
Surely Michael Gorbachev takes some credit for the wall?
I loved the music choices in this vid. And this was a very interesting topic.
That's some great parents.
Okay, seriously, why didn't it show up in my subscription box despite me having you subbed and the bell on?

Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
I dig the sad Tetris theme
It is shocking that East Germany were way behind Poland (my homeland country neighboring with former East Germany) in video games field. In Poland were not produced home computers in late 80' nevertheless they were imported from West Germany (Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and later Amiga). At these times on flea markets you could get many games (of course pirated but back then in Poland were not defined anti-piracy law) therefore we could play many different games from the west. In Poland video game consoles became popular in early 90' when communism was overthrown and one of Polish company imported Taiwan famiclones (Famicom/NES clone) known today as Pegasus. To be honest I miss these days, it was really good times.
It depresses me to know that my parents and other relatives back in Romania had to live and grow up under these conditions and I only narrowly avoided being born under Communism.
But games aren't political though.
What is this? WHAT IS THIS!?? An American talking about something from beyond the Iron Curtain? And doing proper research on it? And presenting it in a bearable manner? my compliments go to that!\n\nWhen I clicked on the video I seriously expected it will be all like HUHUH, they didnt have NENTENDUH, HUHUH, they suck!
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?

When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
This is pure ideology.
When Clair de Lune started playing at the beginning I stated tearing up, god dammit Danganronpa V3
It is true the COCom list made it impossible for us as teenies to get hightech from western Europe, but these rules did not aplly to electronic scrap. Friends of mine in West Berlin sendet me vie postal service carefully seperatet/cutted parts in several packages and we buildet and soldet everything up again. :-) These C4 plus/ C-64 looked a little bit strange afterwards, but we had a working computer at the end. We were creative :-).
Makes me think of the gaming history of my own country somehow - especially the ripoff part haha
MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
This is REAL games journalism. We got SUper Bunnyhop here investigating cool as shit history on videogames and digging up contact info of developers from 30+ years ago, while Kotaku just says you're sexist for playing Minecraft.
This is some real games journalism bruh
I live in east Germany. :) The video is very good as always.
Amazing work George.

Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months

Do .smc roms work?
Legend.
I just lost my audio in the main menu need help.
thanks man. SUPER EASY GUYS! follow instructions and you're good.
Anyone else experiencing delay in sound response since having added games?
Anyone have a link to the oem kernel dump? I missed that step and I need to flash back to original
Just wanna say thank you Eta Prime for the amazing videos and this tutorial. Got my roms and followed your tutorial step by step and my SNES now has 72 of my all time fav. Games. So thank you again and well done sir.
Will n64 roms work with this?
I can’t wait to try this. If I had one..
256Mb flash on the board? wow nintendo really knows how to lowball its consumers.
What's up guy join this channel @bebeandjay00 to have a chance at winning NES classic for free
The mod worked perfectly and I executed it four consecutive times! Thanks again, ETA PRIME!
Whenever I press L+R+Start+Select it just resets the game. It doesn't take me to the hub. Perhaps when you flash it, it adds that feature. Normally it does not work in that fashion. Which is why they are pushing those Wii controllers for the extra Home Button.
How do you add more game? Do you have to do the power reset thing? Could you make a video of adding more.
Do you have to dump the kernal every time you add more games??????
can i use any rom files for the snes?
keep getting cant write to usb
nice
Amazing
Page not found :(
Are EU Version working? Or just the US versions?
So I tried to put battletoads battlemania but it doesn't seem to want work whenever I click on the game it just resets can anyone tell me why? Does anyone else have this issue?
What safe websites can I go on to download games to do all of this? I don't want to get in trouble for downloading roms if it's illegal.
does not work on europe :(
Aside from Chrono Trigger every rpg lover should add Lufia 2 to the snes mini, great game! Also does/will this run patched translated roms like Star Ocean and Seiken Densetsu 3?
I have 91 working right now except they demand to be in a other games folder in the SNES mini with the original 21 showing. I have to go into other games and I can play any of them. I changed the limit to 100 assuming that'd fix the folder issue but oh well it works!\nedit: fixed, forgot to select pages split games equally superb.+
added about 80 games to mine. all work except mario all stars. unsure why.
So if I want to keep the original 21 games, do I have to download those ROMs as well? Or do the new games just get added to the original 21?
Hey man thanks for the video it was very helpful!
I get Nes Mini not found, sorry when I click install driver, following your directions at the dump kernel step. Tried all my usb ports (they are all 3.0), tried stock cable, and other cables to make sure it wasn't cable. I'm on windows 10.
Works great!! Someone help me find Super Mario All stars and Donkey Country 2 diddy kong. Thanks
Hi, Modding the NES I had problems getting hackchi v2.17d working. At \nthe time of syncing error message WAITING FOR NES... So I used v2.20 \nwhich worked.

RUN V2.20, DUMP KERNEL, INSTALL DRIVER, FLASH ORIGINAL KERNEL, EXIT\n4. RUN V2.17D SCRAPE COVER ART\n5. RUN V2.20 SYNC AND WRITE ROMS \n\nSNES STEPS\n1. SETUP HACKCHI V2.20 WITH MODULES\n2.

Always such clear helpful videos. What a legend!
Hi guys. All works great, but the only niggle is that some of the games have downloaded with spelling errors in the title box. For example, earthworm jim is showing as eartworm im. Has anyone else had this, and how do you rectifty it? thanks guys.
I'm CONSTANTLY getting the error Kernel dumped but the MDS checksum is unknown: f1c07be36baad573d7bc17bc8be22cfa Do you want to continue? I hit yes, and get the same error when flashing the custom kernel and no additional games ever show up. What gives?
Thank you very much my friend, worked fantastic.
Can't get super street fighter 2 to work or alpha
I was waiting for a video like this :)
Thanks, ETA PRIME! I have followed your tutorials for the NES Classic Hakchi and this new SNES Hakchi... They are superb and you make it so simple to follow your instructions. Thank you very much!
SO I have the EU version of the SNES will it work?
The driver keeps saying nes mini not found, sorry. How do I solve this?
I've used the RC4 version (works great) but is it worth using the Hakchi 2.0 official version? Or continue using the debug version?
Do i need to install RC4 or does it come internally with ver2.20?
Wish somebody would make full,and good scrapers
I followed your video perfectly, added about 100 games and was checking them out and testing some. I made a save state in Chrono Trigger and when I turned off the mini I got a C8 error :(\nany idea how to fix it?
Is it worth hacking my SNES Classic if I can already hack my NES Classic? Are the graphics any better or anything like that?
Is there a difference in performance between compressed zips and uncompressed .smc files?
Thank you for this, I modded my mini using this tutorial for the 2.20 HackChi and it worked great. Just a word of advice, the first time you load the new kernal on your tv, it will take a bit of time for it to load up.
Where do I get the ROMS?
can we put nes titles on the snes mini?
Thank God people who hold her views are in the minority.
Great stuff! Most of my additions worked perfectly! Of my original 13, however, three of them had issues and failed in one way or another (Illusion of Gaia got to the start screen with no sound, then froze. Terranigma played but the sound was completely gone save for a random jump noise. Tales of Phantasia completely refused to load and froze before anything popped up.) \n\nMy question: When putting new versions on there, do I have to uninstall those previous ones? Or do I just replace them with the new roms?
Any way to make this work on a Mac
does it make a difference if they are in sfc or smc format?
Does this method erase saved games?
Can someone post a zip of the ROMs along with the box art, and metadata like 1P/2P, supports save, release dates, etc, like someone did for the NES Classic ETA video?
Does retroarch work on the snes as well? I'm interested in putting some gameboy advance roms on it..
wow all i need now is the console
Perfect.  Thank you for this.
Okay, I’m new to this, ive tried (3) Times and I’m only seeing the original games...  are all of my Roms bad?
NTSC-J games work as well, even some english patched ones I tried. However, the NTSC-U rom of Super Street Fighter 2 that I have doesn't boot. The system throws up an error.
@Eta Prime link for the RC is down? Any other link available?
This has been what i've been waiting for.  You are my HERO!
what about running different emulators gbc/gba Sega??
I cant find a working rc4 link
Could anyone please share the RC4 file?  The link isnt working.
Goldeneye 007 next year? Will Nintendo create a Rom where Goldeneye runs perfect on their N64 Classic?
Also the link is 404'd now!
site seems to be down i hope this is only temporary and not a DMCA shutdown or a cease and desist
This is great. Thanks for these videos.
I...I can't believe it. IT WORKED FIRST TRY! This walkthrough was PERFECT. You spoke clearly, repeated necessary information and were very specific throughout the entire video. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
If you wind up bricking your console, you can likely reflash it and get back to gaming
So roms are running on the SNES classic’s own emulator? Or how is this working?
I love watching your videos dude. You are very straight to the point with your tutorials.
Finally cracked it, re-flashed with original kernel.\ndeleted hakchi and re-downloaded.\nrepeated same process I've already done.\nworked a treat
Got about a 100 games on and quite a few have audio issues, just wondering if we should untick compression as they are already rared
L R Start Select is the old Squaresoft code for soft resetting their RPGs.
Is there any risk in doing this on the European SNES mini guys?
I'll wait until the official release because I  do not wanna damage my super Mario RPG &yoshi island files
so I have a question, do we have to go through the same process everytime we want to add more games? thank you for the tutorial worked like a charm!
the link for RC4 download is dead :(
When I dump the kernel it gives me MD5 checksum message.  I'm missing a step?
What format Roms are people using? I have SMC and SFC.
does doing this affect ur save files in the original 21 games???
When I turn mine off I get a C8 error
I'm trying this on a UK SNES Mini with US ROMS.  All seems to work fine with Hakchi but the new games don't show when I power it up, only the original 21.  I have tried a couple of different folder formats but no luck.  Any ideas anyone?
will dump kernal overwrite the NES Mini Kernal I have previously dumped?
It works, it's awesome, the weird thing I get is that if I turn off the snes mini at the menu screen I get a c8 error...but if I turn it off during a game....it turns off fine. Reflashed original, flashed custom, tried it again and still get c8 error. Works for me, which is great, still but minor nuisance.
This may be a dumb question, but is it possible to do all of this using a mac? Or is it only doable on PC?
Where do you plug into the SNES? Like what cable is necessary to connect from the computer to the console?
Please note (best to my knowledge) that the EU PAL edition of the SNES Mini also came with USA installed games. There are no EU Pal games on the system. I guess thats because the EU games ran at 50hz and had those letterbox borders on them.
Will this allow you to add NES games to the SNES as well?
Hey\nI have a very important question. How the f... do i save my game progress for my extra added games, without using the suspend point option? I can't save my progress on the cartridge (rom)? Can we fix that somehow?
Might this be possible, install snes classic kernel?\n convert my mini Classic  NES OS to Snes mini Classic OS
The link no longer exist
Hey I already have a NES Classic with hakchi2, is there any point for me pick up a SNES Classic? I'm honestly just curious sense I heard that they supposedly have the exact same hardware.
Followed Directions to a T here.  No games are popping up in menu.  Even after selecting (pages, split games equally) No gray folder either.  Just the same setup as I had.  Holding RL Start and Select only resets the game as well.\n  ANY IDEAS?
does this remove progress from my snes? I have about 10 hours into ff3. also during the initial plug in flash where it tells you to install driver, should I install driver after doing all the previous steps?
Thank you ETA Prime! I have been looking forward to adding about 6-8 more games to mine. \nQuestion can anyone confirm this method keeps using the original SNES emulator (Canoe?). I was not interested in installing RetroArch or anything since we already have a Pi for that. The SNES Mini seems to emulate the games it has more accurately (less lag) and I would like to use it for other games If possible
Official 2.20 HackChi !!!!\nhttps://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2/releases/
Not feeling that 3D boxart. Pic is too skewed. Looks like when self publishing authors use that program to make their ebook cover to look like a physical hard cover book.  Not a criticism of ETA, just expressing an opinion. Thanks for the upload.
I bricked mine dammit! Just kiddin works great so far.
nice  my dream love to see KILLER INSTINCT  arcade on  snes mini
So roms are running on the SNES classic’s own emulator? Or how is this working?
Works a treat, I was a bit sceptical at first, and was caught in 2 minds when it came to flashing the Kernel etc, but I got it to work! A brilliant tutorial, thanks. Anyone who's unsure, take it from me. If you follow exactly what's being said; you'll be chuffed.
Got about a 100 games on and quite a few have audio issues, just wondering if we should untick compression as they are already rared
Just added 20 games, they all work perfectly, adding them didn't erase your previous save points, some games like earthworm Jim 1-2 and chronic trigger reset the game when you press L+R+Sel+start, so if you want to make a save point make sure you hit the reset switch on the console, if you press the controller buttons you are gonna reset the game and the save point will only be a reseted game and one last thing if you choose to display te games on the menu, the little thumbnails will only fit 31 games, you can see them on the big thumbnail bit not on the little one on the bottom (the little stripe with all the thumbnails)
Just picked my favs thanks for the tut
My curated game list is ~80 games and even that is a little much I think. I could probably cut it down to 60 roms that I love. Thanks for the videos on the SNES classic.
can't dump kernel
Do .smc roms work?
I did all of the steps from the video. But when I go to use my SNES Classic it's the stock UI with the original 21 games. No folder contain extra games I just added
@ETA Prime.. congrats long time sub jere. You made it on the trending page with this vid.
Hello and thank you for the work\nI'm currently trying to do it on my NES Mini (not SNES) (Hakchi2.21b), but here is what I receive as a message after dumping the kernel and clicking Continue to upload games.\n\nshell command tar -xvC/var/lib/hakchi/rootfs/usr/share/games/nes/kachikachi returned exit code 1:tar: can't change directory to 'var/lib/hakchi/rootfs/usr/share/games/nes/kachikachi': No such file or directory\n\nI'm on WIndows 10\n\nThanks for the help
Legend.
Yeah... I dont like the 3D boxes for this...
keep getting cant write to usb
Dumb Question,  For UK Super NES do I pick SNES or Super Famicom.
Thanks you saved me
thank you
How do I add Raspian? Lmao, j/k
When doing my one, I found when using USB 2 the Mini kept disconnecting from my PC (right in  the middle of dumping the rom) ...Maybe not enough power...So I tried the USB 3 port and that stopped the problem.  Lucky it weren't flashing the Kernel. Other than that 2.20 seems to work 100%
thanks man. SUPER EASY GUYS! follow instructions and you're good.
Anyone else experiencing delay in sound response since having added games?

So is this using the official emulator or is a 3rd party one being used?
Does this keep the save states I still have  if I leave “original games” on?
Thanks for showing. I'll wait for the Pal version.
Would we be able to add NES games in parallel to SNES games?
Man I Watch all your videos love them very helpful and freaking amazing also I ordered that snes classic shell for a pi lol I wish there was a super famicom one to but oh well side note I did preorder the Japanese famicom classic super and the European versions so I’ll be getting them soon so excited bro keep going!!!
best games to add?
I knew it wouldn't take long before this thing got hacked. It had all the same internals as the NES Classic. Fun stuff
Thanks ETA - Stunt Race FX here I come!
Can you put nes games on there too?
Any way to make this work on a Mac
I love watching your videos dude. You are very straight to the point with your tutorials.
Finally cracked it, re-flashed with original kernel.\ndeleted hakchi and re-downloaded.\nrepeated same process I've already done.\nworked a treat
Works perfect!! I now have over 40 games and still adding more to my snes mini awesome vid thanx for the info !!
I live in Europe. What should i select SNES Classic or Super Famicom Classic?
I don't like the box art
Can you also put NES games on it?
I'll wait until the official release because I  do not wanna damage my super Mario RPG &yoshi island files
Is there any risk in doing this on the European SNES mini guys?
i would like to convert my mini Classic  NES OS to Snes mini Classic OS.
so I have a question, do we have to go through the same process everytime we want to add more games? thank you for the tutorial worked like a charm!
I noticed Hakchi 2 you used here gave you the option of selecting the NES mini. Could you use this same process to add SNES games to an NES mini? I was lucky enough to get the NES mini, but the SNES is proving to be more difficult lol
Hey\nI have a very important question. How the f... do i save my game progress for my extra added games, without using the suspend point option? I can't save my progress on the cartridge (rom)? Can we fix that somehow?

This may be a dumb question, but is it possible to do all of this using a mac? Or is it only doable on PC?
somehow, none of the links work, and the one on clusters page says that error 404 no found
Can't do it if you don't have one!
Thank you for the tutorial. Now I can add my favourite games just  like I did with your NES vid.
does doing this affect ur save files in the original 21 games???
Tried 3 times, games on system but not showing on Menu
Where do you plug into the SNES? Like what cable is necessary to connect from the computer to the console?

Please note (best to my knowledge) that the EU PAL edition of the SNES Mini also came with USA installed games. There are no EU Pal games on the system. I guess thats because the EU games ran at 50hz and had those letterbox borders on them.
Will I lose my current saves or does it keep the original games and saves when adding new ones?
Hello i have a PAL Console can i use PAL Roms? or i have to convert to NTSC
L, R, Start, Select is supposed to reset the game. I guess hakchi modified this original behaviour.
Ricegum took the L
10/10 according to Edge! :O
Really dorky but I liked it.
This was a nice musical number. I haven't bought a nintendo console/game since the wii, would I buy a switch? It's still a maybe for me.
I would take this as a movie. A Mario musical based on this game. Sign me up.
But what about The Living Tombstone's remix?
There better be a dlc for just dance that has the Mario odyssey song, so I can finally learn how to do the Mario.
Been waiting for this ever since the day the song came out. No joke.
1 like=1 lesson about how to dance like Mario
This is OMG I love it
I'm Mexican and i love the Mexican Mario.
Man they are making it really hard not to buy a switch
anyone tried the demo? \nThe game Deserves all the hype
I really thought the guy in the couch was cnd
This is quite amazing is there a chance we can get them dancing in their fancy suites only really like to see the whole dance number
lel blue joy con= botw red joycon = mario odyssey\nthat would be a cool commercial
And i though Mario cant get better
Now THIS is advertising. None of that Wii U era nonsense.
Those of you who keep complaining that this is cringe, go look up The Legend of Zelda A link to the past SNES Japanese commercial...
Can’t get the song out of my head!
I will cleanse this COUNTRY from IMMIGRANTS with bleach by Kidnapping IMMIGRANTS and forcing them to drink BLECH!!! MwhA hahaha!!!
Well well well... Is time to get a switch.
Imagine this in japanese. Perfect op
This video has our childhood that we grew up with, will be a legend in our hearts. Thank you Nintendo for everything.
IM SO READY FOR THIS GAME TO BE OUT.
SOB this is what I've been asking for months!
I got a notification of this on my Wii U.
@ 1:21 I wonder if the fish swim away from you
Looks like mario needs to celebrate first before rescuing peach again XD
where is the green guy?
On of the reasons to be alive , just this
ODYSSEY YES SEE ODYSSEY YES SEE\nI HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HYPED FOR A FREAKIN VIDEO GAME BEFORE
Watching Mario dance like that reminds me of Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix. They should bring back that game it was fun and entertaining.
that's not new york, that's montevideo's city!!
Oh mario, back at it again with mind-controlling innocent kids.
Can’t wait for la la land 2 on The 27th
Something tells me that the game is going to be good
How marketing should be.
IS THIS GONNA BE A REAL MUSICAL IF YES COME TO THE NETHERLANDS URMERGURD 😱
This makes me so happy <3 <3 <3
All this promotion for a mario game and no demo on of the game on the eshop? This is unheard of
When's Mario Iliad coming out
Nintendo really did it with this one! This game is gonna be great!
Im a adult now, but i cant handle the hype, Mario is my hero
Nintendo please stop! I cant take all of this in at once, im dying, call 911, oml help
In still waiting for a sunshine 2 or a remaster. :/
Probably gonna be one of the best Mario games in a long time.
These ads have such an amazing amount of thought and charm into them, they make me so happy
Everyone knows women don't wear ties.
ive been listening to this all day! mario odyssey hype is real! thumbs up if you are READY TO JUMP UP YOU SUPERSTAR!
I have so much love for mario😍😍😍 #love4marioodyssey
So same game with possession powers added oh also newer graphics ?
This game looks sooooo good ya see (pun intended)
I would have liked to see them dance during the OdysSEY YESSY....... OdysSEY! YESSY! part, then my hype would have been built dancing along to the  music alone.
This songs reminds me that Christmas 2017 is coming....
I just came for the living tombstone...
1:24 I just love rewatching this part because of how happy the dinosaur looks walking around haha
Someone put scary music over this
10/10 cuz mario is still a dinosaur in this game
Seeing Mario take over real people's bodies is very creepy.\n\nAnd yet I still love him.
Now THIS is marketing
Oh boy, I love making head calls!
I'm vary existed for this game mama mia 2 more weeks!!! let's a go!! 😎😎😎😎
he still have the same yahoo i love lol😂
I need this game to live
On trending...\n\n\n\n\nThat's right
Nintendo please make a new zelda game for 3ds, it would be awesome if modern link was in it, or phantom hour glass/ wind waker link as well
0:26  YEAh THAT WAY!
Mario= bad hombre
My eyes are teary.
Nintendo is too cool.
i think i saw phantom r # rhythmthief2confirmed
#21 on trending oh yea hype for mario
Just Dance: Super Mario Edition
Pauline looks so hot.
Look at those shoes shine
My Boi
this is DOOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPEEEE <3 <3 <3
Just plain Awesome!
VIVA MEXICO :Y VIVA NINTENDO I buy súper Mario odyssey now.
Take the hint Broadway, Take the hint
10 outta 10 babyyyy
Yes yes YES!!!!!!!!!!!
1:05 yall know damn well why he ran
Pure nostalgia.
15 days OMGGGGGGG
do you even dab, super bro?
0:16 Super Mario 64 sound effects
WAO
0:37 Mario controls Mario. It's Marioception
booooooooo! wheres the 90's Mario!
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IT
How long before the SJW's make them take out Mexicano Mario?
game looks great. id stream it. BUUUUUUUUUT. yeah nintendo can take their profit share and shove it.
lots of yummy scrumptious looking white people :)
Why did Daisy get replaced by a real person?
Anyone bouncing on taxis like that would be in jail... just saying.
They really couldn't come up with better lyrics than odyssey yessey?
I think that is Keeley Bumford singing the song. not sure though. She did the singing for Bayonetta 2 which was great as well. Or at least it really sounds like her.
honestly who would want to play this ima stick with infante warfare
Nintendo is on fire making these awesome trailers!
Nintendo in 1986: let's make a Zelda rap \nNintendo in 2006: Orchestras for everything\nNintendo in 2015: 90s style music.\nNintendo in 2017: Jazz
Nintendo, why? Now I expect you to make a full musical on Mario Odyssey. You've raised the bar too much, and I don't appreciate that because I'm short. You need to lower it a bit so I can actually stand a chance at meeting any expectations. Looking forward to the game <3.
THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE THING
Tell me why the guy at the end sounds like he is wearing a retainer.
0:37 MARIO THAT IS A HUMAN PERSON DO NOT
I got this as an ad... so I watched the whole thing
What an awesome ad! \nMy whole family can't wait to play later this month!
AND LUIGI WERE IS LUIGI >:v
who's the girl?
I love this song
Im soo happy right now I cant stop smiling. Mario games are always been my childhood favorites. I luv you Nintendo!
Is this the ps4 trailer.
Mario Odyssey Is the true Odyssey
Why don't they have a Mario movie yet?
why did they pan the bass to the left in the song. feels off
Hmm... it’s fantastic!\nTho, Mario’s legs had a bit of trouble
This is marketing done right
I always wondered whatever happened to Carmen Sandiego.
This shows nintendo can pull of a live action film with an animated mario
Can’t wait for the game
They are going all nothing for 1 game
Are you going to make legend of Zelda again
So this is how Super Mario Odyssey looks on the ps4....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnah
God I wish I had a switch
But yet, how not many people have the switch like me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI LIVE A LIFE OF TORTURE WITHOUT IT
Am I the only one who thought persona when they heard the music?
When you thought Mario and the other people where dabing...\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANK LORD BOWSER
Can you guys make one with the whole song
Looks like they learned from their marketing mistakes from the wiiu
Dam Nintendo, even in a commercial you make everything look amazing
Between this and that Fire Emblem thing I'm really liking all the old school-style Nintendo live action shenanigans.
WHY IS THIS ANIMATION PIXAR-LEVEL QUALITY
Mario is old but he still got those dance moves :D
I grew out of mario and nintendo years ago, not my thing anymore...\n\n...but now i want a nintendo switch just for this game...
Im going to enjoy this game more than Zelda not really a huge Zelda fan no offensive
This needs to be in Just Dance 2018
This will be the best Mario game
I only have a Nintendo DS from 2006
1K Microsoft and Sony Fanboys triggered by how good this video is. 😂😂😂
This was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
0:33\nI've played Odyssey at a convention. The fact that this guy is running straight and not zigzagging is odd.
Super Mario Odyssey live musical please :)))))
0:30 Singing in the Rain -1952
looks like Mario droped the plumbing business for dancing
1:06 I love a crowd people are following him and he’s trying get away
This is so good I JUMP IN THE AIR Nintendo MY HAT IS OF TO YOU
at this point i've sold my soul to nintendo
Nintendo has gone maximum overdrive on us.
2ds mario's are a thing of the past.
I'm just gonna comment
This game looks very fun like it a mixture of games like Sonic Colors, Super Mario Sunshine, and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. I would buy it and I don't play a lot of Nintendo games; not saying Nintendo is bad because there amazing be personal I'm a Xbox and PC type of guy.
Rehearsal for opening summer olympics 2020 Tokyo!!!
Apparently, Mario is a mob leader in New York.
its was sick when Mario threw his hat and came out of nowhere
I WANT IT OUT NOW
Nintendo is determined to get every Switch owner to get this game the day it comes out. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I’m pretty most people were sold by the e3 trailer if they weren’t already from the Trailer at the Switch presentation
IT'S TIME TO JUMP UP IN THE AIR! DON'T BE SHY, DON'T BE SCARED BECAUSE I'LL BE YOUR 1 UP GIRL!
Mario is DANCING 11/10 video
looks better than sonic forces
미틴 짱이다 ㅋㅋ

*fills playlist with Mario oddessy remixes*
is it just me who thinks mario is overrated and dont give a flying f#ck about his games
Pure cringe
at 0:47, why are two people playing a single-player mario? \n\nEveryone in the comments seem to be raving about how amazing this looks...and I'm stuck here baffled at the blatant false advertisement....Two people controlling one Mario! PSH!
is it possible for you guys to make gta san andreis for nintendo switch
Your my favourite company ever! 👍👍👍 plz reply
Isn't the Pauline in this game marios sister
Do you have to legit flick the joycon? Cool
Whoever disliked this video has to have some sort of mental disorder.
can we all take a moment to appreciate the INSANE ANIMATION QUALITY.
really sad that iwata had to die before this masterpiece came along\nthanks iwata, see you next game.
Wow nintendo is back again with the over the top commercials...
That's some jojo poses my guy
Mario can dance better than all of us
Y Nintendo y?  Never make Mario dance again
BOI WE GUYS AND DOLLS NOW
0:35 when denis is playing  Super Mario Odyssey
Mario in real life sorta? Idk... I just don’t feel right...\nOverall this is a great game,\n\n\n\nGET IT? OVERALLS?
I would hug Mario if he was real. My ♥️in video games was because of him
All I need is good grades and I get $140 so I can buy this game, this is gonna be awesome.
Whoever disliked this wouldn't know good animation and music if it killed them.
Can't believe dog mario is real
OK IM CROSSING THE LINE AT MARIO DANCING AND POSSESSING RANDOM PEOPLE IN THE STREET
As Mario throws his hat taking control of your very soul forcing you to do unimaginable actions and framing you for countless murders as you can only sit there and watch as he uses your abilities to murder your friends and family and innocent people...
Super Mario Odyssey is not a musical
do you know gaming with kev
I can’t wait for super Mario oddessy 😁
Pauline please succ me\nMario please defeat all the jerks who disliked this

I wonder how hard it was for those actors to perfectly execute every action and dance move. There are some very talented people promoting a video game. Also the design of that Pauline dress was so spot on it HURTS. In short, this video must have been a total pain to make. Not to mention the editing and animation, now THAT'S true dedication.
Can we get a free public demo for Mario Oddessey Please
Everyone on the street looks like Michael Jackson. lolz
0:16 I haven't heard that mario voice clip since Mario 64. Nice throwback.
Parts of this sync really well with Bruno Mars' Treasure. Doesn't really matter, I just found it amusing.
like a mario game!!!!!!! all!!!!!!
Like for mario mexican
This game is going to be great! Keep it up Nintendo! (BTW I LOVE THIS SONG)
Woooh its comminggg AND I NOT HAVE A SWITCH :(
Only complaint I would have about this particular trailer is the lack of diversity--where are all the people of color? haha. Otherwise, great production value! Love the game and I love Nintendo. Can't wait!
On the thumbnail, i thought it was mario and michael jackson
TheLivingTombstone's remix of it tho....
Nintendo is going above and beyond in its marketing for both the console and more importantly the games and not only catering its advertising specifically to the Western market by making the product clearer, but insuring that whether or not we can play the game we can look forward to its release and share laughs and smiles with people who can play the game. The big N is back with a vengeance and ready to make all of us happy, whether we have to shell out to them or not.
This is Nintendo’s first step in movie production.
bet she can take a potato
Odyssey to the se! Ody-Wait...WHY so many dislikes ;-;.\n\nEdit:fixed grammar errors.And who’s hyped? :D
I just got enough money for the switch and didnt know how much i had, now i really wish i didnt spend like 150 already
I'll be sure we see Mario he's super.
I pre ordered this game i cant wait
When I saw the main trailer I thought that it was going to be boring but when I herd the song...😍😍
Imagine the luck of these dancers. Now they can put in their resumes that they danced a musical with Mario
I already know its going to be lit... But 13 more days :(
I'm adicitited to this song and the singer and Mario and the band and the color and the dance andeverything about the video
I would buy it if i had a switch
Cappy: Mario, aren't we suppose to be saving Pea-                                                                                                                                                            Mario: HUSH I WANT TO BE A SMOOTH CRIMINAL!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cappy: *sigh*
Ive never been so excited for a mario game or a mario musical before
This honestly has to be the best add I've seen
Anyone else think it looks like Mario is dabbing in the thumbnail with rest of the people?😂
mario it trash \nsonic is love
all i'm saying is where can i get one of em hats?!?! looks like it would help out enormously... #atthebackofthecoffeeline
I hope Luigi and some other characters can be playable at some point
0:21 look at Marios hair so detailed \n\nIs Mario old???
I can't wait till it comes out!!!😄😄😄😄
This game looks like it's going to be the ultimate Mario feel good adventure. I'm going to be having a grand 'ole time running around the worlds with my new best friend cappy. I also dig the Mario Party 2 vibes with all the costumes and such.
Who else wants a full length Super Mario Odyssey Musical now?
Wow, it looks WAY more realistic now! Damn!
why drive that scooter when you can posses the scooter
Two more weeks today.
Before I clicked this video, I thought it was going to be C R I N G É. \n\nIt turned out to be the B E S T video I’ve watched on YouTube this year!
if only Iwata was here to see how Nintendo is ruling 2017 :(
I added Tom Jones to it for you on my channel.
More of a Zelda fan myself, but dang man, I'm excited to play this.\nProbably haven't been this excited for a game since... Breath of the Wild... huh. Funny how that works out.
Tbh i dont realy like this i feel like mario should just die the time he was around was fun but this is too much and too long its getting boring and stupid all the work put in this amazing vid is fine but its just my opinion
Sonic: So Mario, How Does It Feel To Be Right Next To ACTUAL People?
Just a couple... more... weeks...
There is gonna be so much series of this when it comes out
Mario looks SO realistic
7k - Sonic & Sega Fans\n94k - Mario & Nintendo Fans
OMG mario looks so realistic 😀😀good job Nintendo
Cringe
#HYPE
RIP my money
Satoru Iwata would be proud.
Seems legit
Nintendo win everythink

Stop
AMAZING !
Am I the only one who noticed the girls at 0:48 where playing together?
0:48 two persons playing mario odissey?
SUPER MARIO BROADWAY SHOW \n\nIT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
When Nintendo releases a new game it's an EVENT
Do the Mario! Swing your arms from side to side\nCome on, it's time to go. Do the Mario!\nTake one step, and then again\nLet's do the Mario, all together now! You got it! It's the Mario! Do the Mario!\nSwing your arms from side to side\nCome on, it's time to go. Do the Mario!\nTake one step, and then again\nLet's do the Mario, all together now!\nCome on now. Just like that!
its that time of the year again. . .
That man was lucky enough to have Mario become one with him.
A fat midget dancing looks really dumb\nOh wait that’s mario
Mario looks good in a sombrero!
This is what should show up when you search suicide prevention
Wow,I didn't know that Mario could dance this great.
This song feels like a really good anime intro
I like how the original Donkey Kong theme is incorporated into this song.
Sonic is crap, I'm still a fan of Sonic but I prefer Mario over this
When mario's hat is more famous than he is, they make a game out of it.
I love you Nintendo I have all your consals
My dear Mario,what have they done to you
I like it but the dancing is ugly also I’m being mario for Halloween cause mario is amazing 🌝👌🏻
The trailer was so pretty my mom legitimately thought this was a movie trailer.
0:10 okay so they’re wondering what’s going on and then suddenly get possessed by “Mid-20th century song and dance” syndrome. Gotcha Nintendo
It would be funny if just a just dance game had this as a switch exclusive
I'm Flipping The Switch\n\nNintendo Switch is being Disbanded Confirmed
I love when Nintendo does stuff like this.
0:40 was the best part of the song imo
0:16 ahh... I remember that sound from super Mario 64
now this is how you make an ad
This is true beauty.
I like the music
7K people got their hat stomped on by Bowser.
I wish I could play that
the new mario 64 looks good
Whoops, 7k people missed the like button
Was anyone else thinking that if the ad 'took' inspiration from 'La La Land' it actually doesn't seem to really conflict with the 'cheeriness' of a Mario game?.
This music reminds me of super Mario land for some reason
Back to high quality commercials I see
I'm honestly floored at this musical actually made it to France as *the official TV advertisement.*
so broadway ,so new york, so la la land
I'm getting this game for Christmas
Mario obtained the power of possession
count on nintendo to have the most hear warming games ever
This song is actually lit af.
If this doesn't get in iTunes I'm gonna get cancer in my ear
Give me one reason why this won't be the game of the year.
Can this be the music for the game
Hey Nintendo why don't you do a new super smash bros for the Nintendo switch and 3DS
Sorry, those 7k dislikes were my neighbors. I was blasting this song all night. My bad.
Yet me still waiting for the newest 2d mario platform on the switch
Lets start the countdown to jurassic mushroom Kingdom (super Mario odyssey).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dance number still made it a pass and Mario rule 34 gets a pass to but Sonic rule 34 does not. Good thing Nintendo did not make a Photo realistic Mario. With sonic 06 was it weird to see a cartoonish hedgehog in a world of photorealistic humans not saying it's a bad thing but do some people like myself find it odd. Or not wereplumber\n\nI knew w in this game Mario is with humans but the game is still cartoonish unlike sonic 06
Great video! This has got me absolutely hyped for the upcoming game!
It's finally out.
This game and Stranger Things season 2 is coming out on the same day
The first time I seen this trailer, I thought to myself: is that the donkey Kong girl from the really old games of dk, OMG yes. did anybody else think that?
Wow look at 0:19 and look at the bottom right corner
Welcome to New York Normies
This should be on billboard top 100
Did anyone else spot the Odyssey at 1:11?
T h i s   i s   r e a l   m u s i c
This game is already a 10000000/10
Possibly the Nintendo's version of Grand Theft Auto.
MARLO is Cool and Good
Who thinks they should make a Super Mario Galaxy 3 after this?\n#SuperMarioGalaxy3
Nintendo must be on drugs cuz they have never been so good
I like how that they put 1950s theme to it
Time to ruin this song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎶 DO THE MARIO! SWING YOUR ARMS, FROM SIDE TO SIDE-🎵
I don't need it....\n*Good graphics*\nI don't need it....\n*Music with lyrics*\nI DEFINITELY don't need it....\n*Customize Mario's clothing*\nI don't need it....\n*Open world adventure*\nI don't need it....\n*Turn into anything using Cappy*\nI don't-\n*Pauline returns*\n...\nI NEEEEEEEED ITTTTTTTTT!!!!

The 7k dislikes are sonic fans
Whhhhhooooaaaaa! *internal fangirling*
AWESOME!
C'mon dab
Who tf dislikes this amazing video?
What.
My body and mind are ready for this game but my wallet isn't smh. 😔
cool game dont quit mario odssey
the video is cringe but the song is good
E10+ is a step in the right direction, not everyone that plays Nintendo are kids, 10 is still a kid, but you get the idea
Swing
The game looks great, but I'm  waiting for one playable character I'm looking forward too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*LUIGI*
👎👎👎👎
The dislikes are from Sony fans.
It’s like another super mario galaxy game kinda
All these kids with switches and I’m over here still begging
Can we plz take a moment to notice how hot that last in the red suit was?
Just realized, the people in this video are all white.
I'm just worried by taking it to a modern real world setting it would be bad. Just like what happened to Sonic... oh please prove me wrong!
Ricegum took the L
More like Oculus, Go Home, You're drunk \n\nAmirite?\n\n\nHello?\n\n\n\nAnybody?\n\n\n\nHillary did 9/11 stay woke
But does it do porn.
Will the close display damage eyesight at all?
Subscribe to Colin flaherty the truth
I'm going to guess the $1k PC or console and controllers aren't included at the price. :D
What can it run ? Can i run every Occulus Game on it ? I think not or ?
VR is barely scraping the market,so let's make a smaller, portable and expensive one!\nTaking tips from Sony - just like with the PSP
Pokemon Go hype didn't happen because of the word Go. Just saying.
Yeah but does it blend
Is trending just advertisements \nOr am i wrong
We are living in a simulation. Someone above us already invested this.
VR is nice and all, but I believe AR is much more accessible and sense-friendly in that you DON'T have to blind yourself to have a great experience. Not to mention I'm spooked by VR progressing beyond just a wearable screen and controllers.
I stopped liking this when I read from facebook.
Lets GET THIS TO #1 TRENDING BOI'S
Why is this on trending?
Go? Really? It's way to obvious why you chose that tag. You couldn't have done like oculus motion or literally any other word
Only $505165131651 get it now
lmao, 80,000 views and its 2nd on trending.Conservative videos reach billions in a day or so, only an hour on trending before its taken down. YouTube's Algorithm my ass
So electronic Velcro? What's with the random lights on the strap?
For 200 dollars more you can a legit VR headset... I mean I guess this is cool if all you want to do is watch some movies and sheeit or if you dont have a decent PC. The more people who experience VR the better widen the consumer base.
This doesn't tell me shit and why was it so loud
In 5 years this is going to be the equivalent of the big grey phone when cell phones first came out
Nope. Waiting for generation 10 at least.
Im so confused, what do it do? what are the features? a video about nothing...
But but I just got the new vr
So a rebranded gear VR that works on all phones... except iPhone of course
With the price it’s more like Oculus no
Not buying anything associated with Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg
wtf!? WHAT ABOUT MY OCULUS RIFT + TOUCH HEY WHAT THE FUCK WHERE ARE MY GAMES!
How about Oculus NO...\nhaha...\n.\nha\n.\n.\n. \n\nI'll leave
How about fixing your old s*** before you start making new.
Just wait till people will crash with this device:(.                               \n\n\n\n\nWhen you know your still going to use the Oculus Go when you drive
Some fucking dumbasses will crash their car while wearing this
Ah I just cracked my phone and than they make this why why
VR that’s no longer tethered to a PC will change the game, especially at the cheaper price. Wish the video released some specs though.
i feel that this device is just good enough for streaming video
Introduce the Camera you're using
How long until another company remakes this but changes it slightly and claims it as their own? Also without giving credit to oculus
Yay another shitty product so I can beat off in 3 dimensions
GOTTA OCULUS GO TO THE STORE NOW
That's pretty ok 👌
So.. I guess this is for those who absolutely cannot afford a smart phone or a decent PC? How would they spend $199 for VR? If this is an embedded hardware, it also means it is not expandable and will become obsolete faster than any other VR headsets.
Thx this is a must buy
So they made a portable version of something you need to be stationary to use...nice
Cool cool but what's the difference between this one and anyother?
So how do you catch pokemons with this?
This looks like a siege operator intro
What makes this different from the normal one? I didn’t get that from this trailer.
These are going to be amazing!  Can’t wait.
Lit. Now i can watch vr porn on the go!
yeah but why is this on trending
It's white so it's smarter 😉
I’m really into VR but I don’t get this
Now we just need oculus go to the polls
Reminds me of the Star Trek:TNG episode “The Game”\nhttps://youtu.be/ilIhdTG_UmQ
Now I can look like an even bigger tool in public.
Ha! April fools, you got me
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back. He shed his blood and sacrificied his life so we can be in heaven with him and the Lord! Turn away from your wicked ways and accept Jesus Christ as your SAVIOR!!! HE IS COMING AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR GO TO HELL. WOE ONTO YOU!!
can’t wait i’m about 15 years VR is gonna be way improved. And in 30 even more i feel like it’s inevitable.
I would love this if you could play games like Robo Recall on this, but alas you can't. So really this is like a gear vr. Still really cool and will buy because VR is still an overhyped/priced market.  $200 is nothing if its a premium product for low-end vr content.
37k views. How s this trending!!
PlayStation VR is still king, because you don't need a phone!!
Hope this leads to more porn VR videos being made  :)
Now i can watch porn wherever i want
Aye, something else I can’t afford....
Another spy tool from fakebook that will make us less sociable!! Sounds great!!
Dude I can’t wait to walk in the middle of the street with this shit my ni🅱️🅱️a
It's been a long time coming, and I'm hyped!
Exciting period for Oculus, the main culprit that VR is progressing slowly is the low resolution. Increase to 8k n above, 1 billion user will be in reach.
27 thousand views? Trending? No way Idubbz got 10 million views in one day, and trending never gave him anything
Oculus: Apple Edition

Cant wait, damn the negative replys...
Why is this on trending
So dank will buy again 18283828181/181822288282
So... Google Cardboard: Definitive Edition?
Don't know why some people complaining about Oculus Go.. This is GearVR level headset in just $200. You don't need to pay $800++ anymore. \nYes, it has no positional tracking, but this is only $200! Santa Cruz prototype will cost a lot more, you will see. \nP.s. I personaly will buy this just to watch movies in virtual cinema. For me it's dream come true..
For $200 I'm in.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
The VIVE is still better though o3o
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class
ELECTRONEUM... THE NEXT BITCOIN!?\n\nIt's worth buying at least $100 and see what happens. Many people wish they knew about Bitcoin before it took off! \n\nBitcoin started at $0.003 and is now over $5,000 each coin!\nThis new coin is in Pre-market Sale right now through October first. Offering an extra 10% bonus coins with each purchase! Coin sale is at $0.01 per Coin.

This thing better have a gtx 1080

I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
VR is a disaster
What generation of iPhone is this?
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s
This came out the same day I got my oculus rift
More like Oculus stop\n amirite guys \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a life
Why does the FCC have a say, when will they say, when will you sell. This advert is less than ideal.

WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it
GO? Go where? You're completely blind folded.
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain
Wow look a waste of money!!!
Will gangbang porn be better with these?
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
In portuguese Glass means Óculus. Oculos, get it?!
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
no more looking at your kids stupid faces in the car rides home
So will this be used for phones or what?
I don't get the on the go part?
Does it connect to steam?
and how to connect, wifi ?
Your move Vive. Let's have a full blown VR war that's actually affordable.
Ppl will think they can drive with them on
Vr is dead. Stop already
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
Fuck facebook, I will not give them a cent of my money. Garbage of a company.
If it is possible to connect it to my pc to it then I'm buying it
Cell phones are among the foulest items that are on this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they grow like fungus where it is decay, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a cell phone and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the cell phone will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.\n\n Arguably the scariest magical (technological) item of the your universe, a  cell phone feeds upon human happiness and leaves its victim in a state of depression and despair. The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth
Wait these guys aren't dead?
So basically Rick and Mortys vr thing

As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
At least Facebook is still trying.
$200?! I'm actually excited to get this
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.

So no pc connection? What makes this better than my phone thrown in one of those google cardboard boxes for like 5 bucks max? I'm only here for the mobile VR porn anyways.
will this work in steam vr?
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.

Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
I need it!
Oculus Go *WASTE YOUR MONEY*

No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
Vr is dead. Stop already
Wow look a waste of money!!!
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
Will i able to buy this in or from Singapore??
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.
Too bad vr sucks
Nobody cares about VR
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
VR is a disaster
OCULUS SUCKS, VIVE IS BETTER
By stand-alone I’m guessing it won’t need a PC or smartphone?
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
So will this be used for phones or what?
So no pc connection? What makes this better than my phone thrown in one of those google cardboard boxes for like 5 bucks max? I'm only here for the mobile VR porn anyways.
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
$1000?
fuck facebook
will this work in steam vr?
Will Oculus Go support Home and Dash?
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.
As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
At least Facebook is still trying.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class

I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
More like Oculus stop\n amirite guys \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a life

WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it

I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain

1:06 I live in berlin and never knew about this sooooo....yeah ;)
Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
This video infuriates me so much!\n\nHey, lets make a video about gaming in the Soviet Bloc. Obvious choice are the countries in the former Soviet Union, but nah, F those Ruskies. How about Bulgaria or Romania, countries  outside what most Westerners consider the Soviet Bloc? You just answered your own question! How about Yugoslavia, a sui generis country with a Marxist-Leninist ideology but outside the Soviet Bloc? Who cares about those losers? OK, lets focus on East Germany, a geopolitical region that outside of 50-some-odd years of communist rule in nonetheless an integral part of Western Civilization? Bingo!
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.
Dude, you really have a lot of talent. As cliche as it sounds, this really has a lot of meaning in the scientific community as it stands in america. The government holding back its citizens in scientific discovery is mind boggling.
Thats a new subject matter. DANKA  I am makeing subscrib to wonderful YouTubes channel.
How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the Денде?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
This is pure ideology.
When Clair de Lune started playing at the beginning I stated tearing up, god dammit Danganronpa V3
This is REAL games journalism. We got SUper Bunnyhop here investigating cool as shit history on videogames and digging up contact info of developers from 30+ years ago, while Kotaku just says you're sexist for playing Minecraft.
It is true the COCom list made it impossible for us as teenies to get hightech from western Europe, but these rules did not aplly to electronic scrap. Friends of mine in West Berlin sendet me vie postal service carefully seperatet/cutted parts in several packages and we buildet and soldet everything up again. :-) These C4 plus/ C-64 looked a little bit strange afterwards, but we had a working computer at the end. We were creative :-).
This is some real games journalism bruh
I live in east Germany. :) The video is very good as always.
Makes me think of the gaming history of my own country somehow - especially the ripoff part haha
MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
I got an update for you, the iron courtain doesn't exist anymore, nice bait fgt
would love to see more videos like this Georgie porgie.
In Hungary the curtain was a bit more loose, so there were zx Spectrums at schools, and also c64 and amiga smuggled from Austria. Videoton also made some pong console clones, and there was the fairly popular Yellow Cartridge Nintendo ( sárga kazettás ) clone console.\nThere's a documentary about the Commodore64 game developement called Moleman 4 - Longplay.\nAlso all those Trabants make me feel nostalgic. We had one until 2007.
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
1:05 I am German and I did not know that East Germany had video games at that point in time either.
ah well, the memories. As a eastern germany kid the only games I was able to play until the wall was torn down were the one in Polyplay and I loved them. Thankfully we have a Polyplay in a local bar here.
I think of all soviet block countries Poland was in best gaming shape.
As an eastern german it is nice to watch a video about this topic. It was a strange and weird time for us here. Also interesting because I visited the Computerspielmuseum this spring too and it was really interesting, absolute worth it.  Perhaps an idea for the future would be a video about the console usage in eastern europe after 89. I know here and also in brasil the Sega Master System was the dominant console for a short time. My first own console was a Sega MS II with Sonic included until I got an PSX as a birthday gift, I skipped the 16 bit era entirely. \n\nBy the way, I am not so sure that Yager Entertainment is an east german company, the buisness address is in Kreuzberg, West-Berlin. But the managing director Timo Ullmann studied at the Humbolt university, East-Berlin. Berlin not really east or west more its own thing so hard to tell. But this is not that important.
Keep in mind, that Densi dound its way to Russia after fall of USSR and was, essentially, a cheap alternative of NES, since the pric of the latter was around 2 or 3 (maybe more) montly family budgets.
That was a fantastic video! Thank you!
Please make a video about gaming in communist Poland. It's actually quite an interesting topic.
Germany was pretty fucked up at the time.\nWestern germany was pretty much enslaving eastern germany to produce a lot of products like furniture and many other things for a low price while eastern germany didn't even have acces to many of those things.\nAnd the reason why this was going on for so long is simply because western germany  only made profits while the east wasn't able to develop and fight back.\nThere are many stories out there and if you got caught trying to cross the well protected border, you were either caught and put behind bars if you were lucky or shot on the spot like a dog in the streets.\nYou also were not allowed to leave the country (GDR or DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) as we call it in germany) without permission to do so wich still was pretty restricted to say the least. \nTo this day, western germany is much more developed and has higher wages than eastern germany BUT the cost of living there is also much higher.\nIt's still pretty fucked up in my opinion and with all the new people streaming in from the southeast, the government is putting a lot of money into programs for them like learning german and everything surrounding work and stuff wich leaves germans in the dust.\nBut I guess in 3 to 5 years everything will get better once all those people got integrated into our society.\nSorry for drifting off lol
Down with communist and socialist.
Great vid George! A West-German approves.\nAnd just the right amount of Hoff - you brilliant bastard you!
Honestly getting a guided tour at the Stasi museum was the final nail in the coffin for believing communism could ever work. It's basically just one giant den of nepotism.
so let me be your token german george.....  the DDR had video games?°_°
East Germany was famous for manufacturing the world's largest microchips.
for thanksgiving i am thankful for this channel.
That song that played at 8:51 does anyone know what it is? I keep hearing it randomly in different forms whenever I hear something USSR related...
Vinyl records were once  used to store computer data????? I honestly didnt know that was possible. Fascinating.
Fantastic video as always George! Thanks :)
danm, this is great. Thanks George!
Impressive work George, well done!
This is so interesting, thank you!
I visited that museum last year and they've got a lot of interesting things in there. Berlin is a fantastic destination in general. The food, beer and nightclubbing are next level.
Good Video. And i thank our capitalistic comrades (Patreons) to make this available to the working class. (And that it didn't took 5 years trto make. Comrad Georg is such an overachiever)
The biggest praise I can give you as a colleague doing political journalism in Denmark is that you are perhaps the only actual games journalist. As in, you do a story, choose an angle, do actual research, interviews, sort through prior work in the area, work the story and piece together something original and enlightening. All the while tackling each subject and game with an adult eye for balance, history and nuance... well, except for when you talk about MGS, maybe ;)\n\nThe fact that you have an education while most of your contemporary colleagues are basically amateur bloggers really shines through.\n\nKudos, man. It's a joke that you're not looked on as an obvious main inspiration for the genre of video game journalism.
this was a really well done and interesting video article.  Good Job George, and thank you for the content you put out.
The GDR was actually called the DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) in German.\n\nPretty big missed opportunity for a joke there George.
that elephant is trespassing on mario world 1-2. tsk
Thank you George! Very interesting and informative, and one of those things you never know you wanted to know until you find out about it
I always freaking forget:\nWhat's the name of the piano piece at the start of the video?
sure. first thing you make when you get your hands on a cpu is a game. then some work for the socialist threadmill
Regan was more responsible for it than any other individual person...don't know why you would add that little text.
Man, what an interesting video.
Poor east german kids didn't have a nes, poor latvian kids didn't have a potato.
This is not interesting. Enough 'travel logs' Herodotus
As someone who lived in the region that was formerly known as 'West Germany' (lived pretty close to the French Border, as a matter of fact) for 10 years, I actually find it interesting to learn about what was going on in the Eastern half since I never got to go anywhere near the former GDR in my lifetime. I find it amazing how East Germans were able to improvise on how they got their video games and such. \n\nIt's still a shame that you could still feel the effects of this to this very day.
Absolutely fascinating. Love hearing history about the Cold War.
Noodles Man, aren't Germany's kid stories more gory than these games?
The Dendy is actually a Taiwanese clone console,its just sold in Russia.
This is the most interesting video I've ever seen about a subject I've never had a shred of interest in.\nFantastic work, Georgy-boy.
As a russian I'm very proud that you notice the Dendy and Kinamania's Documentary FIlm about that. Can you make a video about Soviet and Russian Gaming, please?
NOOOOOOOOOOOODDLLEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Trending. Nice job George!
#43 on Trending. Nice!
Karl Marx Ave. ah Soviet Union

Lovely report, thank you Bunnyhop.
heheh the mgs3 beginning.
Fascinating
boy gaming in commieland sure sounds great!
ZED X
Superior video
DENDY!!! T____T
Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months
>Capitalist Luxury
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
imagine the games we could create if east germany rose again\nI'd be the leader of the new gdr and I'd allow war games as long as they where through perspective of eastern countries
Your videos keep making this political scientist smile. Keep up the good work
I strongly recommend to the people who liked this video to watch the Dendy russian video about an angry russian dude (acting like the AVGN) talking about his childhood playing those NES knockoffs and ports of newer games on that nes hardware. It's very interesting and fun to watch!
When it worked.\n\nIt never worked. That's why the lines and the poverty were so different when the unification happened.
But nintendo is eastern.
So this might be an influence to why Yager made the most prolific anti-war war game to date?
I had never thought of, or even thought to think of, gaming in the Eastern Bloc.\nExcellent topic choice, and as usual, excellent video.\nThank you for this!
That museum was very cool. Really liked seeing the old games and tech.
lol, my mum didn't see a pineapple till she was 18, let alone video games
I visited the museum last year with my college class it was extremely interesting(The pain station was the center piece of our whole time there, did you play it bunny?) but they never quite went into how the machines etc. were programmed that was very interesting finding it out from this video. \nDid you manage to get to the DDR museum bunny? I found it very interesting as well.
Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
The Hudson river, two years ago...
I am glad that Marxism did not prevail in the free world.
The Stasi secret police museum is actually not very far away from the video game museum. It's 10 minutes on the train system they have there.
It's not that related to the topic at hand, but that museum is great. In there you can have a chat with one of the first chat bots called Eliza, created in the 60-s. When I was there I told it it's 2014 and it told me I'm insane.\n\nThey also have the weirdest arcade pong machine called Pain station. You move the bar by rotating an analog tumbler with your right hand, while your left hand is pressed against a metal grate with electric contacts. If you take your left hand off that grate, you lose. The gist is - every time you miss a ball, random danger zones appear on the screen. If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts. We've had enough after like 5 minutes. The record holder, as we were told, has managed to endure this for several hours.
amazing ingenuinity on part of east german programmers, even if their gaming industry never kicked off\nimagine playing western games for hours so that you can make your own copy from scratch and discussing coding with other programmers through (non-electronic) mail\nhats off to people like andre weißflog
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...
btw dendy is a chinese system and was simultaneously on market with sega16bit and ps1 (n64 and snes too but no one ever cared about nintendo)
wow this video made it into youtube's trending, well deserved in my opinion
This is also the case in all of the former soviet bloc countries. Taping software/games on cassettes in order to share them to the few people who had some sort of bootleg commodore 64 was common practice.
Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.

I got an update for you, the iron courtain doesn't exist anymore, nice bait fgt
would love to see more videos like this Georgie porgie.
In Hungary the curtain was a bit more loose, so there were zx Spectrums at schools, and also c64 and amiga smuggled from Austria. Videoton also made some pong console clones, and there was the fairly popular Yellow Cartridge Nintendo ( sárga kazettás ) clone console.\nThere's a documentary about the Commodore64 game developement called Moleman 4 - Longplay.\nAlso all those Trabants make me feel nostalgic. We had one until 2007.
1:05 I am German and I did not know that East Germany had video games at that point in time either.
ah well, the memories. As a eastern germany kid the only games I was able to play until the wall was torn down were the one in Polyplay and I loved them. Thankfully we have a Polyplay in a local bar here.
I think of all soviet block countries Poland was in best gaming shape.
As an eastern german it is nice to watch a video about this topic. It was a strange and weird time for us here. Also interesting because I visited the Computerspielmuseum this spring too and it was really interesting, absolute worth it.  Perhaps an idea for the future would be a video about the console usage in eastern europe after 89. I know here and also in brasil the Sega Master System was the dominant console for a short time. My first own console was a Sega MS II with Sonic included until I got an PSX as a birthday gift, I skipped the 16 bit era entirely. \n\nBy the way, I am not so sure that Yager Entertainment is an east german company, the buisness address is in Kreuzberg, West-Berlin. But the managing director Timo Ullmann studied at the Humbolt university, East-Berlin. Berlin not really east or west more its own thing so hard to tell. But this is not that important.
Keep in mind, that Densi dound its way to Russia after fall of USSR and was, essentially, a cheap alternative of NES, since the pric of the latter was around 2 or 3 (maybe more) montly family budgets.
That was a fantastic video! Thank you!
Please make a video about gaming in communist Poland. It's actually quite an interesting topic.
Germany was pretty fucked up at the time.\nWestern germany was pretty much enslaving eastern germany to produce a lot of products like furniture and many other things for a low price while eastern germany didn't even have acces to many of those things.\nAnd the reason why this was going on for so long is simply because western germany  only made profits while the east wasn't able to develop and fight back.\nThere are many stories out there and if you got caught trying to cross the well protected border, you were either caught and put behind bars if you were lucky or shot on the spot like a dog in the streets.\nYou also were not allowed to leave the country (GDR or DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) as we call it in germany) without permission to do so wich still was pretty restricted to say the least. \nTo this day, western germany is much more developed and has higher wages than eastern germany BUT the cost of living there is also much higher.\nIt's still pretty fucked up in my opinion and with all the new people streaming in from the southeast, the government is putting a lot of money into programs for them like learning german and everything surrounding work and stuff wich leaves germans in the dust.\nBut I guess in 3 to 5 years everything will get better once all those people got integrated into our society.\nSorry for drifting off lol
Down with communist and socialist.
Great vid George! A West-German approves.\nAnd just the right amount of Hoff - you brilliant bastard you!
Honestly getting a guided tour at the Stasi museum was the final nail in the coffin for believing communism could ever work. It's basically just one giant den of nepotism.
so let me be your token german george.....  the DDR had video games?°_°
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
This is one of many reasons as to why I do not support Socialism/Marxism
Born in the GDR in 1981, I am one of those people who suffered from the lack of video games in the early childhood. My first and only gaming experience before the fall of the iron curtain was a few minutes of River Raid (shown in this video). Even after the reunion it took me a little while (christmas 1991 to be exact) to get my first console (the SEGA Master System), because money was short for most former eastern germans and electronic was very expensive (an empty cassette tape for example costed 20 Mark which is around 40-50$ by today's standard) . For a whole year I had only Alex Kidd and Sonic to play, followed by Sonic 2 the next christmas. I'm not really sad about it because I learned to appreciate what I had instead of being jealous of what others had. It had a unique kind of fascination to try out a new game back then and that's what I'm missing today.\nAfter all I (and the former GDR in general) quickly caught up with the latest technology and by the time the fifth generation of video games (N64, Playstation, Saturn) came we were on the same level as the rest of the world, if not earlier.\nWe may have missed some precious childhood experiences back then, but we also learned to respect video games in a way most people didn't :)
And that's why I dislike communism.
Everytime governments think they've controlled markets, people make their choices anyway. This is why black markets exist.
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?
If only communism would've actually been a good way to run a country and not make everyone hate it and want to leave, because ultimately it's not in our nature to behave that way.\nI was born way past that time, but it does sound like a fucking nightmare. By the by, I never learned stuff like this in school. All we ever talked about was how bad Hitler was and nothing else, like what our country was actually like.
With people even resorting to broadcasting source code to each other over the radio... \n\nLook at what lengths these people went to make games work back then! Meanwhile publishers like 2K can't be bothered to get 2K18 under freaking 16 GB for the Switch...
The Dendy is actually a Taiwanese clone console,its just sold in Russia.
This is the most interesting video I've ever seen about a subject I've never had a shred of interest in.\nFantastic work, Georgy-boy.
NOOOOOOOOOOOODDLLEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Trending. Nice job George!
Lovely report, thank you Bunnyhop.

Trending!!!! My boyyyy
**!GEHALTEN!**
ICH BIN EINE GAMER!
Bin ich der einzige Deutsche hier?
Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
8:08 thanks for the fan service george
This story is a jewel. I have researched the history of computing in the Warsaw Pact countries and it is wonderful to see the quality of this work. I am grateful. Thank you very much.
7 minutes in and I still don't see the point this video is trying to make...
The animations were my favourite part, Dad Gorg continues to raise the bar for everyone.
Great, informative video! In Finland, we also had commodore programs broadcast over the radio so you could record it on a cassette.
I come close from Koblenz and i wondered why i could never find a NES. gameboy. SNES or any other console/pc on a fleamarket.\nThey didn't have that shit lol.
Great video as always George. I saw a cip from  Curse of the grey elephant at 6:40, did you watched it? Because i would be interested in your thoughts about it.
I spat my drink out when he pronounced comparison , instead of comparishon*
Surely Michael Gorbachev takes some credit for the wall?
I loved the music choices in this vid. And this was a very interesting topic.
That's some great parents.
Okay, seriously, why didn't it show up in my subscription box despite me having you subbed and the bell on?
imagine the games we could create if east germany rose again\nI'd be the leader of the new gdr and I'd allow war games as long as they where through perspective of eastern countries
Your videos keep making this political scientist smile. Keep up the good work

btw dendy is a chinese system and was simultaneously on market with sega16bit and ps1 (n64 and snes too but no one ever cared about nintendo)
wow this video made it into youtube's trending, well deserved in my opinion
I strongly recommend to the people who liked this video to watch the Dendy russian video about an angry russian dude (acting like the AVGN) talking about his childhood playing those NES knockoffs and ports of newer games on that nes hardware. It's very interesting and fun to watch!
When it worked.\n\nIt never worked. That's why the lines and the poverty were so different when the unification happened.
But nintendo is eastern.
So this might be an influence to why Yager made the most prolific anti-war war game to date?
I had never thought of, or even thought to think of, gaming in the Eastern Bloc.\nExcellent topic choice, and as usual, excellent video.\nThank you for this!
That museum was very cool. Really liked seeing the old games and tech.
lol, my mum didn't see a pineapple till she was 18, let alone video games
I visited the museum last year with my college class it was extremely interesting(The pain station was the center piece of our whole time there, did you play it bunny?) but they never quite went into how the machines etc. were programmed that was very interesting finding it out from this video. \nDid you manage to get to the DDR museum bunny? I found it very interesting as well.
Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
I dig the sad Tetris theme
It is shocking that East Germany were way behind Poland (my homeland country neighboring with former East Germany) in video games field. In Poland were not produced home computers in late 80' nevertheless they were imported from West Germany (Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and later Amiga). At these times on flea markets you could get many games (of course pirated but back then in Poland were not defined anti-piracy law) therefore we could play many different games from the west. In Poland video game consoles became popular in early 90' when communism was overthrown and one of Polish company imported Taiwan famiclones (Famicom/NES clone) known today as Pegasus. To be honest I miss these days, it was really good times.
It depresses me to know that my parents and other relatives back in Romania had to live and grow up under these conditions and I only narrowly avoided being born under Communism.
But games aren't political though.
What is this? WHAT IS THIS!?? An American talking about something from beyond the Iron Curtain? And doing proper research on it? And presenting it in a bearable manner? my compliments go to that!\n\nWhen I clicked on the video I seriously expected it will be all like HUHUH, they didnt have NENTENDUH, HUHUH, they suck!
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?
The Hudson river, two years ago...
This is also the case in all of the former soviet bloc countries. Taping software/games on cassettes in order to share them to the few people who had some sort of bootleg commodore 64 was common practice.
I am glad that Marxism did not prevail in the free world.
The Stasi secret police museum is actually not very far away from the video game museum. It's 10 minutes on the train system they have there.
It's not that related to the topic at hand, but that museum is great. In there you can have a chat with one of the first chat bots called Eliza, created in the 60-s. When I was there I told it it's 2014 and it told me I'm insane.\n\nThey also have the weirdest arcade pong machine called Pain station. You move the bar by rotating an analog tumbler with your right hand, while your left hand is pressed against a metal grate with electric contacts. If you take your left hand off that grate, you lose. The gist is - every time you miss a ball, random danger zones appear on the screen. If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts. We've had enough after like 5 minutes. The record holder, as we were told, has managed to endure this for several hours.
amazing ingenuinity on part of east german programmers, even if their gaming industry never kicked off\nimagine playing western games for hours so that you can make your own copy from scratch and discussing coding with other programmers through (non-electronic) mail\nhats off to people like andre weißflog
Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.
1:06 I live in berlin and never knew about this sooooo....yeah ;)
Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.
Dude, you really have a lot of talent. As cliche as it sounds, this really has a lot of meaning in the scientific community as it stands in america. The government holding back its citizens in scientific discovery is mind boggling.
Thats a new subject matter. DANKA  I am makeing subscrib to wonderful YouTubes channel.
How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the Денде?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
This is pure ideology.
When Clair de Lune started playing at the beginning I stated tearing up, god dammit Danganronpa V3
It is true the COCom list made it impossible for us as teenies to get hightech from western Europe, but these rules did not aplly to electronic scrap. Friends of mine in West Berlin sendet me vie postal service carefully seperatet/cutted parts in several packages and we buildet and soldet everything up again. :-) These C4 plus/ C-64 looked a little bit strange afterwards, but we had a working computer at the end. We were creative :-).
Makes me think of the gaming history of my own country somehow - especially the ripoff part haha
MY GOD!!!! Those animations are so realistic its uncanny
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
This is REAL games journalism. We got SUper Bunnyhop here investigating cool as shit history on videogames and digging up contact info of developers from 30+ years ago, while Kotaku just says you're sexist for playing Minecraft.
This is some real games journalism bruh
I live in east Germany. :) The video is very good as always.
Amazing work George.
Man socialism sounds fun.
This is right-wing propaganda!!!!!!

Subscribe to Colin flaherty the truth
I'm going to guess the $1k PC or console and controllers aren't included at the price. :D
What can it run ? Can i run every Occulus Game on it ? I think not or ?
VR is barely scraping the market,so let's make a smaller, portable and expensive one!\nTaking tips from Sony - just like with the PSP
Pokemon Go hype didn't happen because of the word Go. Just saying.
Yeah but does it blend
Is trending just advertisements \nOr am i wrong
We are living in a simulation. Someone above us already invested this.
VR is nice and all, but I believe AR is much more accessible and sense-friendly in that you DON'T have to blind yourself to have a great experience. Not to mention I'm spooked by VR progressing beyond just a wearable screen and controllers.
I stopped liking this when I read from facebook.
Lets GET THIS TO #1 TRENDING BOI'S
Why is this on trending?
Go? Really? It's way to obvious why you chose that tag. You couldn't have done like oculus motion or literally any other word
Only $505165131651 get it now
lmao, 80,000 views and its 2nd on trending.Conservative videos reach billions in a day or so, only an hour on trending before its taken down. YouTube's Algorithm my ass
So electronic Velcro? What's with the random lights on the strap?
For 200 dollars more you can a legit VR headset... I mean I guess this is cool if all you want to do is watch some movies and sheeit or if you dont have a decent PC. The more people who experience VR the better widen the consumer base.
This doesn't tell me shit and why was it so loud
In 5 years this is going to be the equivalent of the big grey phone when cell phones first came out
Nope. Waiting for generation 10 at least.
Im so confused, what do it do? what are the features? a video about nothing...
But but I just got the new vr
So a rebranded gear VR that works on all phones... except iPhone of course
With the price it’s more like Oculus no
Not buying anything associated with Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg
wtf!? WHAT ABOUT MY OCULUS RIFT + TOUCH HEY WHAT THE FUCK WHERE ARE MY GAMES!
How about Oculus NO...\nhaha...\n.\nha\n.\n.\n. \n\nI'll leave
How about fixing your old s*** before you start making new.
Just wait till people will crash with this device:(.                               \n\n\n\n\nWhen you know your still going to use the Oculus Go when you drive
Some fucking dumbasses will crash their car while wearing this
Ah I just cracked my phone and than they make this why why
VR that’s no longer tethered to a PC will change the game, especially at the cheaper price. Wish the video released some specs though.
i feel that this device is just good enough for streaming video
Introduce the Camera you're using
How long until another company remakes this but changes it slightly and claims it as their own? Also without giving credit to oculus
Yay another shitty product so I can beat off in 3 dimensions
GOTTA OCULUS GO TO THE STORE NOW
That's pretty ok 👌
So.. I guess this is for those who absolutely cannot afford a smart phone or a decent PC? How would they spend $199 for VR? If this is an embedded hardware, it also means it is not expandable and will become obsolete faster than any other VR headsets.
Thx this is a must buy
So they made a portable version of something you need to be stationary to use...nice
Cool cool but what's the difference between this one and anyother?
So how do you catch pokemons with this?
This looks like a siege operator intro
What makes this different from the normal one? I didn’t get that from this trailer.
These are going to be amazing!  Can’t wait.
Lit. Now i can watch vr porn on the go!
yeah but why is this on trending
It's white so it's smarter 😉
I’m really into VR but I don’t get this
Now we just need oculus go to the polls

Ha! April fools, you got me
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back. He shed his blood and sacrificied his life so we can be in heaven with him and the Lord! Turn away from your wicked ways and accept Jesus Christ as your SAVIOR!!! HE IS COMING AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR GO TO HELL. WOE ONTO YOU!!
can’t wait i’m about 15 years VR is gonna be way improved. And in 30 even more i feel like it’s inevitable.
I would love this if you could play games like Robo Recall on this, but alas you can't. So really this is like a gear vr. Still really cool and will buy because VR is still an overhyped/priced market.  $200 is nothing if its a premium product for low-end vr content.
37k views. How s this trending!!
PlayStation VR is still king, because you don't need a phone!!
Hope this leads to more porn VR videos being made  :)
Now i can watch porn wherever i want
Aye, something else I can’t afford....
Another spy tool from fakebook that will make us less sociable!! Sounds great!!
Dude I can’t wait to walk in the middle of the street with this shit my ni🅱️🅱️a
It's been a long time coming, and I'm hyped!
Exciting period for Oculus, the main culprit that VR is progressing slowly is the low resolution. Increase to 8k n above, 1 billion user will be in reach.

So... Google Cardboard: Definitive Edition?
Don't know why some people complaining about Oculus Go.. This is GearVR level headset in just $200. You don't need to pay $800++ anymore. \nYes, it has no positional tracking, but this is only $200! Santa Cruz prototype will cost a lot more, you will see. \nP.s. I personaly will buy this just to watch movies in virtual cinema. For me it's dream come true..
For $200 I'm in.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend

I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
VR is a disaster
What generation of iPhone is this?
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s

White and fabric?  That's gonna get dirty too easily.  Especially if you're supposed to have it on the go.
Finially VR hentai games now available to the poor
My game is the best game
but can you use tilt brush, that is the real question
more like oculus go learn how to make a original joke
ok i really wanna buy the oculus rift but an someone explay this to me:\n1. i would like to walk in vr (just move a bit you know) is this possible with 1 camera? or 2?\n2. i saw that its possible to play htc vive games with the rift?? is that true and could someone (short) explain how?\nthank you!
WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it
GO? Go where? You're completely blind folded.
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain
Wow look a waste of money!!!
Will gangbang porn be better with these?
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
In portuguese Glass means Óculus. Oculos, get it?!
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
no more looking at your kids stupid faces in the car rides home
So will this be used for phones or what?
I don't get the on the go part?
Does it connect to steam?
and how to connect, wifi ?
Your move Vive. Let's have a full blown VR war that's actually affordable.
Ppl will think they can drive with them on
Vr is dead. Stop already
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
Fuck facebook, I will not give them a cent of my money. Garbage of a company.
If it is possible to connect it to my pc to it then I'm buying it
Cell phones are among the foulest items that are on this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they grow like fungus where it is decay, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a cell phone and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the cell phone will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.\n\n Arguably the scariest magical (technological) item of the your universe, a  cell phone feeds upon human happiness and leaves its victim in a state of depression and despair. The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth
Wait these guys aren't dead?
So basically Rick and Mortys vr thing
Cool gadget
fuck facebook
No positional tracking means this headset will suck

Oculus Go\nUne réduction de 50 % sur les prix courants\n2.5K display resolution. Hot! Good quality.  \nQuick to get it\nBefore the offer enters into force\n\nhttps://goo.gl/Ky53T4
Will i able to buy this in or from Singapore??
As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
At least Facebook is still trying.
$200?! I'm actually excited to get this
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.
For $200 I'm in.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
The VIVE is still better though o3o
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class

I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls

will this work in steam vr?
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.

White and fabric?  That's gonna get dirty too easily.  Especially if you're supposed to have it on the go.
Finially VR hentai games now available to the poor
My game is the best game
but can you use tilt brush, that is the real question
more like oculus go learn how to make a original joke
ok i really wanna buy the oculus rift but an someone explay this to me:\n1. i would like to walk in vr (just move a bit you know) is this possible with 1 camera? or 2?\n2. i saw that its possible to play htc vive games with the rift?? is that true and could someone (short) explain how?\nthank you!
WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it
GO? Go where? You're completely blind folded.
I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain
Will gangbang porn be better with these?
In portuguese Glass means Óculus. Oculos, get it?!
no more looking at your kids stupid faces in the car rides home
I don't get the on the go part?
$200?! I'm actually excited to get this
For $200 I'm in.
What generation of iPhone is this?
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s
This came out the same day I got my oculus rift
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
That’s fresh
I need it!
Oculus Go *WASTE YOUR MONEY*
Wtf runs this thing
Why
Good job oculus!
two questions - weight & battery lifetime?
Anyone reminded of Amusphere from SAO
Wait these guys aren't dead?
So basically Rick and Mortys vr thing
No positional tracking means this headset will suck
Kewl
No.
good idea. will sell

Ready player one
Cool gadget
more electrogadget shit we dont need. next.
Oculus Go F*** Yourself.
Good one. Wondering how fashion startups like Dignyty.com  utilize VR to better match apparel  to prospective buyers.....
🐾
Oculus Go\nUne réduction de 50 % sur les prix courants\n2.5K display resolution. Hot! Good quality.  \nQuick to get it\nBefore the offer enters into force\n\nhttps://goo.gl/Ky53T4
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
Vr is dead. Stop already
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
Too bad vr sucks
Nobody cares about VR
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
VR is a disaster
OCULUS SUCKS, VIVE IS BETTER
By stand-alone I’m guessing it won’t need a PC or smartphone?
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
So will this be used for phones or what?
Wow look a waste of money!!!
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.
So no pc connection? What makes this better than my phone thrown in one of those google cardboard boxes for like 5 bucks max? I'm only here for the mobile VR porn anyways.
Will i able to buy this in or from Singapore??
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
$1000?
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
fuck facebook
Ricegum took the L
10/10 according to Edge! :O
Really dorky but I liked it.
This was a nice musical number. I haven't bought a nintendo console/game since the wii, would I buy a switch? It's still a maybe for me.
I would take this as a movie. A Mario musical based on this game. Sign me up.
But what about The Living Tombstone's remix?
There better be a dlc for just dance that has the Mario odyssey song, so I can finally learn how to do the Mario.
Been waiting for this ever since the day the song came out. No joke.
1 like=1 lesson about how to dance like Mario
This is OMG I love it
I'm Mexican and i love the Mexican Mario.
Man they are making it really hard not to buy a switch
anyone tried the demo? \nThe game Deserves all the hype
I really thought the guy in the couch was cnd
This is quite amazing is there a chance we can get them dancing in their fancy suites only really like to see the whole dance number
lel blue joy con= botw red joycon = mario odyssey\nthat would be a cool commercial
And i though Mario cant get better
Now THIS is advertising. None of that Wii U era nonsense.
Those of you who keep complaining that this is cringe, go look up The Legend of Zelda A link to the past SNES Japanese commercial...
Can’t get the song out of my head!
I will cleanse this COUNTRY from IMMIGRANTS with bleach by Kidnapping IMMIGRANTS and forcing them to drink BLECH!!! MwhA hahaha!!!
Well well well... Is time to get a switch.
Imagine this in japanese. Perfect op
This video has our childhood that we grew up with, will be a legend in our hearts. Thank you Nintendo for everything.
IM SO READY FOR THIS GAME TO BE OUT.
SOB this is what I've been asking for months!
I got a notification of this on my Wii U.
@ 1:21 I wonder if the fish swim away from you
Looks like mario needs to celebrate first before rescuing peach again XD
where is the green guy?
On of the reasons to be alive , just this
ODYSSEY YES SEE ODYSSEY YES SEE\nI HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HYPED FOR A FREAKIN VIDEO GAME BEFORE
Watching Mario dance like that reminds me of Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix. They should bring back that game it was fun and entertaining.
that's not new york, that's montevideo's city!!
Oh mario, back at it again with mind-controlling innocent kids.
Can’t wait for la la land 2 on The 27th
Something tells me that the game is going to be good
How marketing should be.
IS THIS GONNA BE A REAL MUSICAL IF YES COME TO THE NETHERLANDS URMERGURD 😱
This makes me so happy <3 <3 <3
All this promotion for a mario game and no demo on of the game on the eshop? This is unheard of
When's Mario Iliad coming out
Nintendo really did it with this one! This game is gonna be great!
Im a adult now, but i cant handle the hype, Mario is my hero
Nintendo please stop! I cant take all of this in at once, im dying, call 911, oml help
In still waiting for a sunshine 2 or a remaster. :/
Probably gonna be one of the best Mario games in a long time.
These ads have such an amazing amount of thought and charm into them, they make me so happy
Everyone knows women don't wear ties.
ive been listening to this all day! mario odyssey hype is real! thumbs up if you are READY TO JUMP UP YOU SUPERSTAR!
I have so much love for mario😍😍😍 #love4marioodyssey
So same game with possession powers added oh also newer graphics ?
This game looks sooooo good ya see (pun intended)
I would have liked to see them dance during the OdysSEY YESSY....... OdysSEY! YESSY! part, then my hype would have been built dancing along to the  music alone.
This songs reminds me that Christmas 2017 is coming....
I just came for the living tombstone...
1:24 I just love rewatching this part because of how happy the dinosaur looks walking around haha
Someone put scary music over this
10/10 cuz mario is still a dinosaur in this game
Seeing Mario take over real people's bodies is very creepy.\n\nAnd yet I still love him.
Now THIS is marketing
Oh boy, I love making head calls!
I'm vary existed for this game mama mia 2 more weeks!!! let's a go!! 😎😎😎😎
he still have the same yahoo i love lol😂
I need this game to live
On trending...\n\n\n\n\nThat's right
Nintendo please make a new zelda game for 3ds, it would be awesome if modern link was in it, or phantom hour glass/ wind waker link as well
0:26  YEAh THAT WAY!
Mario= bad hombre
My eyes are teary.
Nintendo is too cool.
i think i saw phantom r # rhythmthief2confirmed
#21 on trending oh yea hype for mario
Just Dance: Super Mario Edition
Pauline looks so hot.
Look at those shoes shine
My Boi
this is DOOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPEEEE <3 <3 <3
Just plain Awesome!
VIVA MEXICO :Y VIVA NINTENDO I buy súper Mario odyssey now.
Take the hint Broadway, Take the hint
10 outta 10 babyyyy
Yes yes YES!!!!!!!!!!!
1:05 yall know damn well why he ran
Pure nostalgia.
15 days OMGGGGGGG

0:16 Super Mario 64 sound effects
WAO
0:37 Mario controls Mario. It's Marioception
booooooooo! wheres the 90's Mario!
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IT
How long before the SJW's make them take out Mexicano Mario?
game looks great. id stream it. BUUUUUUUUUT. yeah nintendo can take their profit share and shove it.
lots of yummy scrumptious looking white people :)
Why did Daisy get replaced by a real person?
Anyone bouncing on taxis like that would be in jail... just saying.
They really couldn't come up with better lyrics than odyssey yessey?
I think that is Keeley Bumford singing the song. not sure though. She did the singing for Bayonetta 2 which was great as well. Or at least it really sounds like her.
honestly who would want to play this ima stick with infante warfare
Nintendo is on fire making these awesome trailers!
Nintendo in 1986: let's make a Zelda rap \nNintendo in 2006: Orchestras for everything\nNintendo in 2015: 90s style music.\nNintendo in 2017: Jazz
Nintendo, why? Now I expect you to make a full musical on Mario Odyssey. You've raised the bar too much, and I don't appreciate that because I'm short. You need to lower it a bit so I can actually stand a chance at meeting any expectations. Looking forward to the game <3.
THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE THING
Tell me why the guy at the end sounds like he is wearing a retainer.
0:37 MARIO THAT IS A HUMAN PERSON DO NOT
I got this as an ad... so I watched the whole thing
What an awesome ad! \nMy whole family can't wait to play later this month!
AND LUIGI WERE IS LUIGI >:v
who's the girl?
I love this song
Im soo happy right now I cant stop smiling. Mario games are always been my childhood favorites. I luv you Nintendo!
Is this the ps4 trailer.
Mario Odyssey Is the true Odyssey
Why don't they have a Mario movie yet?
why did they pan the bass to the left in the song. feels off
Hmm... it’s fantastic!\nTho, Mario’s legs had a bit of trouble
This is marketing done right
I always wondered whatever happened to Carmen Sandiego.
This shows nintendo can pull of a live action film with an animated mario
Can’t wait for the game
They are going all nothing for 1 game
Are you going to make legend of Zelda again
So this is how Super Mario Odyssey looks on the ps4....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnah
God I wish I had a switch
But yet, how not many people have the switch like me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI LIVE A LIFE OF TORTURE WITHOUT IT
Am I the only one who thought persona when they heard the music?
When you thought Mario and the other people where dabing...\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANK LORD BOWSER
Can you guys make one with the whole song
Looks like they learned from their marketing mistakes from the wiiu
Dam Nintendo, even in a commercial you make everything look amazing
Between this and that Fire Emblem thing I'm really liking all the old school-style Nintendo live action shenanigans.
WHY IS THIS ANIMATION PIXAR-LEVEL QUALITY
Mario is old but he still got those dance moves :D
I grew out of mario and nintendo years ago, not my thing anymore...\n\n...but now i want a nintendo switch just for this game...
Im going to enjoy this game more than Zelda not really a huge Zelda fan no offensive
This needs to be in Just Dance 2018
This will be the best Mario game
I only have a Nintendo DS from 2006
1K Microsoft and Sony Fanboys triggered by how good this video is. 😂😂😂
This was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
0:33\nI've played Odyssey at a convention. The fact that this guy is running straight and not zigzagging is odd.
Super Mario Odyssey live musical please :)))))
0:30 Singing in the Rain -1952
looks like Mario droped the plumbing business for dancing
1:06 I love a crowd people are following him and he’s trying get away
This is so good I JUMP IN THE AIR Nintendo MY HAT IS OF TO YOU
at this point i've sold my soul to nintendo
Nintendo has gone maximum overdrive on us.
2ds mario's are a thing of the past.
I'm just gonna comment
This game looks very fun like it a mixture of games like Sonic Colors, Super Mario Sunshine, and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. I would buy it and I don't play a lot of Nintendo games; not saying Nintendo is bad because there amazing be personal I'm a Xbox and PC type of guy.
Rehearsal for opening summer olympics 2020 Tokyo!!!
Apparently, Mario is a mob leader in New York.
its was sick when Mario threw his hat and came out of nowhere
I WANT IT OUT NOW
Nintendo is determined to get every Switch owner to get this game the day it comes out. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I’m pretty most people were sold by the e3 trailer if they weren’t already from the Trailer at the Switch presentation
IT'S TIME TO JUMP UP IN THE AIR! DON'T BE SHY, DON'T BE SCARED BECAUSE I'LL BE YOUR 1 UP GIRL!
Mario is DANCING 11/10 video
looks better than sonic forces
미틴 짱이다 ㅋㅋ

*fills playlist with Mario oddessy remixes*
is it just me who thinks mario is overrated and dont give a flying f#ck about his games
Pure cringe
at 0:47, why are two people playing a single-player mario? \n\nEveryone in the comments seem to be raving about how amazing this looks...and I'm stuck here baffled at the blatant false advertisement....Two people controlling one Mario! PSH!
is it possible for you guys to make gta san andreis for nintendo switch
Your my favourite company ever! 👍👍👍 plz reply
Isn't the Pauline in this game marios sister
Do you have to legit flick the joycon? Cool
Whoever disliked this video has to have some sort of mental disorder.
can we all take a moment to appreciate the INSANE ANIMATION QUALITY.
really sad that iwata had to die before this masterpiece came along\nthanks iwata, see you next game.
Wow nintendo is back again with the over the top commercials...
That's some jojo poses my guy
Mario can dance better than all of us
Y Nintendo y?  Never make Mario dance again
BOI WE GUYS AND DOLLS NOW
0:35 when denis is playing  Super Mario Odyssey
Mario in real life sorta? Idk... I just don’t feel right...\nOverall this is a great game,\n\n\n\nGET IT? OVERALLS?
I would hug Mario if he was real. My ♥️in video games was because of him
All I need is good grades and I get $140 so I can buy this game, this is gonna be awesome.
Whoever disliked this wouldn't know good animation and music if it killed them.
Can't believe dog mario is real
OK IM CROSSING THE LINE AT MARIO DANCING AND POSSESSING RANDOM PEOPLE IN THE STREET
As Mario throws his hat taking control of your very soul forcing you to do unimaginable actions and framing you for countless murders as you can only sit there and watch as he uses your abilities to murder your friends and family and innocent people...
Super Mario Odyssey is not a musical
do you know gaming with kev
I can’t wait for super Mario oddessy 😁
Pauline please succ me\nMario please defeat all the jerks who disliked this

I wonder how hard it was for those actors to perfectly execute every action and dance move. There are some very talented people promoting a video game. Also the design of that Pauline dress was so spot on it HURTS. In short, this video must have been a total pain to make. Not to mention the editing and animation, now THAT'S true dedication.
Can we get a free public demo for Mario Oddessey Please
Everyone on the street looks like Michael Jackson. lolz
0:16 I haven't heard that mario voice clip since Mario 64. Nice throwback.
Parts of this sync really well with Bruno Mars' Treasure. Doesn't really matter, I just found it amusing.
like a mario game!!!!!!! all!!!!!!
Like for mario mexican
This game is going to be great! Keep it up Nintendo! (BTW I LOVE THIS SONG)
Woooh its comminggg AND I NOT HAVE A SWITCH :(
Only complaint I would have about this particular trailer is the lack of diversity--where are all the people of color? haha. Otherwise, great production value! Love the game and I love Nintendo. Can't wait!
On the thumbnail, i thought it was mario and michael jackson
TheLivingTombstone's remix of it tho....
Nintendo is going above and beyond in its marketing for both the console and more importantly the games and not only catering its advertising specifically to the Western market by making the product clearer, but insuring that whether or not we can play the game we can look forward to its release and share laughs and smiles with people who can play the game. The big N is back with a vengeance and ready to make all of us happy, whether we have to shell out to them or not.
This is Nintendo’s first step in movie production.
bet she can take a potato
Odyssey to the se! Ody-Wait...WHY so many dislikes ;-;.\n\nEdit:fixed grammar errors.And who’s hyped? :D
I just got enough money for the switch and didnt know how much i had, now i really wish i didnt spend like 150 already
I'll be sure we see Mario he's super.
I pre ordered this game i cant wait
When I saw the main trailer I thought that it was going to be boring but when I herd the song...😍😍
Imagine the luck of these dancers. Now they can put in their resumes that they danced a musical with Mario
I already know its going to be lit... But 13 more days :(
I'm adicitited to this song and the singer and Mario and the band and the color and the dance andeverything about the video
I would buy it if i had a switch
Cappy: Mario, aren't we suppose to be saving Pea-                                                                                                                                                            Mario: HUSH I WANT TO BE A SMOOTH CRIMINAL!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cappy: *sigh*
Ive never been so excited for a mario game or a mario musical before
This honestly has to be the best add I've seen
Anyone else think it looks like Mario is dabbing in the thumbnail with rest of the people?😂
mario it trash \nsonic is love
all i'm saying is where can i get one of em hats?!?! looks like it would help out enormously... #atthebackofthecoffeeline
I hope Luigi and some other characters can be playable at some point
0:21 look at Marios hair so detailed \n\nIs Mario old???
I can't wait till it comes out!!!😄😄😄😄
This game looks like it's going to be the ultimate Mario feel good adventure. I'm going to be having a grand 'ole time running around the worlds with my new best friend cappy. I also dig the Mario Party 2 vibes with all the costumes and such.
Who else wants a full length Super Mario Odyssey Musical now?
Wow, it looks WAY more realistic now! Damn!
why drive that scooter when you can posses the scooter
Two more weeks today.
Before I clicked this video, I thought it was going to be C R I N G É. \n\nIt turned out to be the B E S T video I’ve watched on YouTube this year!
if only Iwata was here to see how Nintendo is ruling 2017 :(
I added Tom Jones to it for you on my channel.
More of a Zelda fan myself, but dang man, I'm excited to play this.\nProbably haven't been this excited for a game since... Breath of the Wild... huh. Funny how that works out.
Tbh i dont realy like this i feel like mario should just die the time he was around was fun but this is too much and too long its getting boring and stupid all the work put in this amazing vid is fine but its just my opinion
Sonic: So Mario, How Does It Feel To Be Right Next To ACTUAL People?
Just a couple... more... weeks...
There is gonna be so much series of this when it comes out
Mario looks SO realistic
7k - Sonic & Sega Fans\n94k - Mario & Nintendo Fans
OMG mario looks so realistic 😀😀good job Nintendo
Cringe
#HYPE
RIP my money
Satoru Iwata would be proud.
Seems legit
Nintendo win everythink

Stop
AMAZING !
Am I the only one who noticed the girls at 0:48 where playing together?
0:48 two persons playing mario odissey?
SUPER MARIO BROADWAY SHOW \n\nIT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
When Nintendo releases a new game it's an EVENT
Do the Mario! Swing your arms from side to side\nCome on, it's time to go. Do the Mario!\nTake one step, and then again\nLet's do the Mario, all together now! You got it! It's the Mario! Do the Mario!\nSwing your arms from side to side\nCome on, it's time to go. Do the Mario!\nTake one step, and then again\nLet's do the Mario, all together now!\nCome on now. Just like that!
its that time of the year again. . .
That man was lucky enough to have Mario become one with him.
A fat midget dancing looks really dumb\nOh wait that’s mario
Mario looks good in a sombrero!
This is what should show up when you search suicide prevention
Wow,I didn't know that Mario could dance this great.
This song feels like a really good anime intro
I like how the original Donkey Kong theme is incorporated into this song.
Sonic is crap, I'm still a fan of Sonic but I prefer Mario over this
When mario's hat is more famous than he is, they make a game out of it.
I love you Nintendo I have all your consals
My dear Mario,what have they done to you
I like it but the dancing is ugly also I’m being mario for Halloween cause mario is amazing 🌝👌🏻
The trailer was so pretty my mom legitimately thought this was a movie trailer.
0:10 okay so they’re wondering what’s going on and then suddenly get possessed by “Mid-20th century song and dance” syndrome. Gotcha Nintendo
It would be funny if just a just dance game had this as a switch exclusive
I'm Flipping The Switch\n\nNintendo Switch is being Disbanded Confirmed
I love when Nintendo does stuff like this.
0:40 was the best part of the song imo
0:16 ahh... I remember that sound from super Mario 64
now this is how you make an ad
This is true beauty.
I like the music
7K people got their hat stomped on by Bowser.
I wish I could play that
the new mario 64 looks good
Whoops, 7k people missed the like button
Was anyone else thinking that if the ad 'took' inspiration from 'La La Land' it actually doesn't seem to really conflict with the 'cheeriness' of a Mario game?.
This music reminds me of super Mario land for some reason
Back to high quality commercials I see
I'm honestly floored at this musical actually made it to France as *the official TV advertisement.*
so broadway ,so new york, so la la land
I'm getting this game for Christmas
Mario obtained the power of possession
count on nintendo to have the most hear warming games ever
This song is actually lit af.
If this doesn't get in iTunes I'm gonna get cancer in my ear
Give me one reason why this won't be the game of the year.
Can this be the music for the game
Hey Nintendo why don't you do a new super smash bros for the Nintendo switch and 3DS
Sorry, those 7k dislikes were my neighbors. I was blasting this song all night. My bad.
Yet me still waiting for the newest 2d mario platform on the switch
Lets start the countdown to jurassic mushroom Kingdom (super Mario odyssey).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dance number still made it a pass and Mario rule 34 gets a pass to but Sonic rule 34 does not. Good thing Nintendo did not make a Photo realistic Mario. With sonic 06 was it weird to see a cartoonish hedgehog in a world of photorealistic humans not saying it's a bad thing but do some people like myself find it odd. Or not wereplumber\n\nI knew w in this game Mario is with humans but the game is still cartoonish unlike sonic 06
Great video! This has got me absolutely hyped for the upcoming game!
It's finally out.
This game and Stranger Things season 2 is coming out on the same day
The first time I seen this trailer, I thought to myself: is that the donkey Kong girl from the really old games of dk, OMG yes. did anybody else think that?
Wow look at 0:19 and look at the bottom right corner
Welcome to New York Normies
This should be on billboard top 100
Did anyone else spot the Odyssey at 1:11?
T h i s   i s   r e a l   m u s i c
This game is already a 10000000/10
Possibly the Nintendo's version of Grand Theft Auto.
MARLO is Cool and Good
Who thinks they should make a Super Mario Galaxy 3 after this?\n#SuperMarioGalaxy3
Nintendo must be on drugs cuz they have never been so good
I like how that they put 1950s theme to it

What.
My body and mind are ready for this game but my wallet isn't smh. 😔
cool game dont quit mario odssey
the video is cringe but the song is good
E10+ is a step in the right direction, not everyone that plays Nintendo are kids, 10 is still a kid, but you get the idea
Swing
The game looks great, but I'm  waiting for one playable character I'm looking forward too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*LUIGI*
👎👎👎👎
The dislikes are from Sony fans.
It’s like another super mario galaxy game kinda
All these kids with switches and I’m over here still begging
Can we plz take a moment to notice how hot that last in the red suit was?
Just realized, the people in this video are all white.
I'm just worried by taking it to a modern real world setting it would be bad. Just like what happened to Sonic... oh please prove me wrong!

But does it do porn.
Will the close display damage eyesight at all?
Subscribe to Colin flaherty the truth
I'm going to guess the $1k PC or console and controllers aren't included at the price. :D
What can it run ? Can i run every Occulus Game on it ? I think not or ?
VR is barely scraping the market,so let's make a smaller, portable and expensive one!\nTaking tips from Sony - just like with the PSP
Pokemon Go hype didn't happen because of the word Go. Just saying.
Yeah but does it blend
Is trending just advertisements \nOr am i wrong
We are living in a simulation. Someone above us already invested this.
VR is nice and all, but I believe AR is much more accessible and sense-friendly in that you DON'T have to blind yourself to have a great experience. Not to mention I'm spooked by VR progressing beyond just a wearable screen and controllers.
I stopped liking this when I read from facebook.
Lets GET THIS TO #1 TRENDING BOI'S
Why is this on trending?
Go? Really? It's way to obvious why you chose that tag. You couldn't have done like oculus motion or literally any other word
Only $505165131651 get it now
lmao, 80,000 views and its 2nd on trending.Conservative videos reach billions in a day or so, only an hour on trending before its taken down. YouTube's Algorithm my ass
So electronic Velcro? What's with the random lights on the strap?
For 200 dollars more you can a legit VR headset... I mean I guess this is cool if all you want to do is watch some movies and sheeit or if you dont have a decent PC. The more people who experience VR the better widen the consumer base.
This doesn't tell me shit and why was it so loud
In 5 years this is going to be the equivalent of the big grey phone when cell phones first came out
Nope. Waiting for generation 10 at least.
Im so confused, what do it do? what are the features? a video about nothing...
But but I just got the new vr
So a rebranded gear VR that works on all phones... except iPhone of course
With the price it’s more like Oculus no
Not buying anything associated with Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg
wtf!? WHAT ABOUT MY OCULUS RIFT + TOUCH HEY WHAT THE FUCK WHERE ARE MY GAMES!
How about Oculus NO...\nhaha...\n.\nha\n.\n.\n. \n\nI'll leave
How about fixing your old s*** before you start making new.
Just wait till people will crash with this device:(.                               \n\n\n\n\nWhen you know your still going to use the Oculus Go when you drive
Some fucking dumbasses will crash their car while wearing this
Ah I just cracked my phone and than they make this why why
VR that’s no longer tethered to a PC will change the game, especially at the cheaper price. Wish the video released some specs though.
i feel that this device is just good enough for streaming video
Introduce the Camera you're using
How long until another company remakes this but changes it slightly and claims it as their own? Also without giving credit to oculus
Yay another shitty product so I can beat off in 3 dimensions
GOTTA OCULUS GO TO THE STORE NOW
That's pretty ok 👌
So.. I guess this is for those who absolutely cannot afford a smart phone or a decent PC? How would they spend $199 for VR? If this is an embedded hardware, it also means it is not expandable and will become obsolete faster than any other VR headsets.
Thx this is a must buy
So they made a portable version of something you need to be stationary to use...nice
Cool cool but what's the difference between this one and anyother?
So how do you catch pokemons with this?
This looks like a siege operator intro
What makes this different from the normal one? I didn’t get that from this trailer.
These are going to be amazing!  Can’t wait.
Lit. Now i can watch vr porn on the go!
yeah but why is this on trending
It's white so it's smarter 😉
I’m really into VR but I don’t get this
Now we just need oculus go to the polls
Reminds me of the Star Trek:TNG episode “The Game”\nhttps://youtu.be/ilIhdTG_UmQ
Now I can look like an even bigger tool in public.
Ha! April fools, you got me
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back. He shed his blood and sacrificied his life so we can be in heaven with him and the Lord! Turn away from your wicked ways and accept Jesus Christ as your SAVIOR!!! HE IS COMING AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR GO TO HELL. WOE ONTO YOU!!
can’t wait i’m about 15 years VR is gonna be way improved. And in 30 even more i feel like it’s inevitable.
I would love this if you could play games like Robo Recall on this, but alas you can't. So really this is like a gear vr. Still really cool and will buy because VR is still an overhyped/priced market.  $200 is nothing if its a premium product for low-end vr content.
37k views. How s this trending!!
PlayStation VR is still king, because you don't need a phone!!
Hope this leads to more porn VR videos being made  :)
Now i can watch porn wherever i want
Aye, something else I can’t afford....
Another spy tool from fakebook that will make us less sociable!! Sounds great!!
Dude I can’t wait to walk in the middle of the street with this shit my ni🅱️🅱️a
It's been a long time coming, and I'm hyped!
Exciting period for Oculus, the main culprit that VR is progressing slowly is the low resolution. Increase to 8k n above, 1 billion user will be in reach.
27 thousand views? Trending? No way Idubbz got 10 million views in one day, and trending never gave him anything
Oculus: Apple Edition
Oculus Go fuck yourself!

More like Oculus No\nAMIRITE HEHEHHEIEUEHIEHEH\nJk
Cant wait, damn the negative replys...
Why is this on trending
So dank will buy again 18283828181/181822288282
So... Google Cardboard: Definitive Edition?
Don't know why some people complaining about Oculus Go.. This is GearVR level headset in just $200. You don't need to pay $800++ anymore. \nYes, it has no positional tracking, but this is only $200! Santa Cruz prototype will cost a lot more, you will see. \nP.s. I personaly will buy this just to watch movies in virtual cinema. For me it's dream come true..
For $200 I'm in.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
The VIVE is still better though o3o
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class
ELECTRONEUM... THE NEXT BITCOIN!?\n\nIt's worth buying at least $100 and see what happens.

Offering an extra 10% bonus coins with each purchase! Coin sale is at $0.01 per Coin.

Now fix your customer service department. It's rubbish
So, nobody’s gotten the memo that VR is a stupid gimmick? SadX
Can you watch porn on it, asking for a friend.
This thing better have a gtx 1080
https://youtu.be/Cm8V8TTJNpo Please support my MOVEMENT! 🔥🔥🔥💯 #Real
I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
VR is a disaster
What generation of iPhone is this?
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s
This came out the same day I got my oculus rift
More like Oculus stop\n amirite guys \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a life

WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it
GO? Go where? You're completely blind folded.
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain
Wow look a waste of money!!!
Will gangbang porn be better with these?
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
In portuguese Glass means Óculus. Oculos, get it?!
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
no more looking at your kids stupid faces in the car rides home
So will this be used for phones or what?
I don't get the on the go part?
Does it connect to steam?
and how to connect, wifi ?
Your move Vive. Let's have a full blown VR war that's actually affordable.
Ppl will think they can drive with them on
Vr is dead. Stop already
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
Fuck facebook, I will not give them a cent of my money. Garbage of a company.
If it is possible to connect it to my pc to it then I'm buying it
Cell phones are among the foulest items that are on this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they grow like fungus where it is decay, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a cell phone and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the cell phone will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.\n\n Arguably the scariest magical (technological) item of the your universe, a  cell phone feeds upon human happiness and leaves its victim in a state of depression and despair. The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth
Wait these guys aren't dead?
So basically Rick and Mortys vr thing
Cool gadget

As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
At least Facebook is still trying.
$200?! I'm actually excited to get this
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.

So no pc connection? What makes this better than my phone thrown in one of those google cardboard boxes for like 5 bucks max? I'm only here for the mobile VR porn anyways.
will this work in steam vr?
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.

That’s fresh
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.
As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
At least Facebook is still trying.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—

Subscribe to Colin flaherty the truth
I'm going to guess the $1k PC or console and controllers aren't included at the price. :D
What can it run ? Can i run every Occulus Game on it ? I think not or ?
VR is barely scraping the market,so let's make a smaller, portable and expensive one!\nTaking tips from Sony - just like with the PSP
Pokemon Go hype didn't happen because of the word Go. Just saying.
Yeah but does it blend
Is trending just advertisements \nOr am i wrong
We are living in a simulation. Someone above us already invested this.
VR is nice and all, but I believe AR is much more accessible and sense-friendly in that you DON'T have to blind yourself to have a great experience. Not to mention I'm spooked by VR progressing beyond just a wearable screen and controllers.
I stopped liking this when I read from facebook.
Lets GET THIS TO #1 TRENDING BOI'S
Why is this on trending?
Go? Really? It's way to obvious why you chose that tag. You couldn't have done like oculus motion or literally any other word
Only $505165131651 get it now
lmao, 80,000 views and its 2nd on trending.Conservative videos reach billions in a day or so, only an hour on trending before its taken down. YouTube's Algorithm my ass
So electronic Velcro? What's with the random lights on the strap?
For 200 dollars more you can a legit VR headset... I mean I guess this is cool if all you want to do is watch some movies and sheeit or if you dont have a decent PC. The more people who experience VR the better widen the consumer base.
This doesn't tell me shit and why was it so loud
In 5 years this is going to be the equivalent of the big grey phone when cell phones first came out
Nope. Waiting for generation 10 at least.
Im so confused, what do it do? what are the features? a video about nothing...
But but I just got the new vr
So a rebranded gear VR that works on all phones... except iPhone of course
With the price it’s more like Oculus no
Not buying anything associated with Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg
wtf!? WHAT ABOUT MY OCULUS RIFT + TOUCH HEY WHAT THE FUCK WHERE ARE MY GAMES!
How about Oculus NO...\nhaha...\n.\nha\n.\n.\n. \n\nI'll leave
How about fixing your old s*** before you start making new.
Just wait till people will crash with this device:(.                               \n\n\n\n\nWhen you know your still going to use the Oculus Go when you drive
Some fucking dumbasses will crash their car while wearing this
Ah I just cracked my phone and than they make this why why
VR that’s no longer tethered to a PC will change the game, especially at the cheaper price. Wish the video released some specs though.
i feel that this device is just good enough for streaming video
Introduce the Camera you're using
How long until another company remakes this but changes it slightly and claims it as their own? Also without giving credit to oculus
Yay another shitty product so I can beat off in 3 dimensions
GOTTA OCULUS GO TO THE STORE NOW
That's pretty ok 👌
So.. I guess this is for those who absolutely cannot afford a smart phone or a decent PC? How would they spend $199 for VR? If this is an embedded hardware, it also means it is not expandable and will become obsolete faster than any other VR headsets.
Thx this is a must buy
So they made a portable version of something you need to be stationary to use...nice
Cool cool but what's the difference between this one and anyother?
So how do you catch pokemons with this?
This looks like a siege operator intro
What makes this different from the normal one? I didn’t get that from this trailer.
These are going to be amazing!  Can’t wait.
Lit. Now i can watch vr porn on the go!
yeah but why is this on trending
It's white so it's smarter 😉
I’m really into VR but I don’t get this
Now we just need oculus go to the polls
Reminds me of the Star Trek:TNG episode “The Game”\nhttps://youtu.be/ilIhdTG_UmQ
Now I can look like an even bigger tool in public.
Ha! April fools, you got me
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back. He shed his blood and sacrificied his life so we can be in heaven with him and the Lord! Turn away from your wicked ways and accept Jesus Christ as your SAVIOR!!! HE IS COMING AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR GO TO HELL. WOE ONTO YOU!!
can’t wait i’m about 15 years VR is gonna be way improved. And in 30 even more i feel like it’s inevitable.
I would love this if you could play games like Robo Recall on this, but alas you can't. So really this is like a gear vr. Still really cool and will buy because VR is still an overhyped/priced market.  $200 is nothing if its a premium product for low-end vr content.
37k views. How s this trending!!
PlayStation VR is still king, because you don't need a phone!!
Hope this leads to more porn VR videos being made  :)
Now i can watch porn wherever i want
Aye, something else I can’t afford....
Another spy tool from fakebook that will make us less sociable!! Sounds great!!
Dude I can’t wait to walk in the middle of the street with this shit my ni🅱️🅱️a
It's been a long time coming, and I'm hyped!
Exciting period for Oculus, the main culprit that VR is progressing slowly is the low resolution. Increase to 8k n above, 1 billion user will be in reach.
27 thousand views? Trending? No way Idubbz got 10 million views in one day, and trending never gave him anything

Why is this on trending
So dank will buy again 18283828181/181822288282
So... Google Cardboard: Definitive Edition?
Don't know why some people complaining about Oculus Go.. This is GearVR level headset in just $200. You don't need to pay $800++ anymore. \nYes, it has no positional tracking, but this is only $200! Santa Cruz prototype will cost a lot more, you will see. \nP.s. I personaly will buy this just to watch movies in virtual cinema. For me it's dream come true..
For $200 I'm in.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls

Cell phones are among the foulest items that are on this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they grow like fungus where it is decay, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a cell phone and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the cell phone will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.\n\n Arguably the scariest magical (technological) item of the your universe, a  cell phone feeds upon human happiness and leaves its victim in a state of depression and despair. The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth
Wait these guys aren't dead?
So basically Rick and Mortys vr thing

OCULUS SUCKS, VIVE IS BETTER
more electrogadget shit we dont need. next.
Oculus Go F*** Yourself.
Good one. Wondering how fashion startups like Dignyty.com  utilize VR to better match apparel  to prospective buyers.....
Follow me!
wow! http://www.ebay.com/itm/253202403957?var=&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649
But does it play knack?
Ready player one
Expensive...
Accessible VR, smart move.
Thats so cool!
This was stupid

That explained NOTHING. Boring ass ad
Hard pass.
So wtf does it do

im eating cocoa krispies
Oculus Go\nUne réduction de 50 % sur les prix courants\n2.5K display resolution. Hot! Good quality.  \nQuick to get it\nBefore the offer enters into force\n\nhttps://goo.gl/Ky53T4
Will i able to buy this in or from Singapore??
As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
At least Facebook is still trying.
$200?! I'm actually excited to get this
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.
For $200 I'm in.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
The VIVE is still better though o3o
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class
ELECTRONEUM... THE NEXT BITCOIN!?\n\nIt's worth buying at least $100 and see what happens.

Offering an extra 10% bonus coins with each purchase! Coin sale is at $0.01 per Coin.

Now fix your customer service department. It's rubbish
So, nobody’s gotten the memo that VR is a stupid gimmick? SadX
Can you watch porn on it, asking for a friend.
This thing better have a gtx 1080
https://youtu.be/Cm8V8TTJNpo Please support my MOVEMENT! 🔥🔥🔥💯 #Real
I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
VR is a disaster
More like Oculus stop\n amirite guys \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a life
Why does the FCC have a say, when will they say, when will you sell. This advert is less than ideal.
By stand-alone I’m guessing it won’t need a PC or smartphone?

Finially VR hentai games now available to the poor
My game is the best game
but can you use tilt brush, that is the real question
more like oculus go learn how to make a original joke
ok i really wanna buy the oculus rift but an someone explay this to me:\n1. i would like to walk in vr (just move a bit you know) is this possible with 1 camera? or 2?\n2. i saw that its possible to play htc vive games with the rift?? is that true and could someone (short) explain how?\nthank you!
What generation of iPhone is this?
WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it
GO? Go where? You're completely blind folded.
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain
Wow look a waste of money!!!
Will gangbang porn be better with these?
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
In portuguese Glass means Óculus. Oculos, get it?!
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
no more looking at your kids stupid faces in the car rides home
So will this be used for phones or what?
I don't get the on the go part?
Does it connect to steam?
and how to connect, wifi ?
Your move Vive. Let's have a full blown VR war that's actually affordable.
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s
This came out the same day I got my oculus rift
Vr is dead. Stop already
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?

So no pc connection? What makes this better than my phone thrown in one of those google cardboard boxes for like 5 bucks max? I'm only here for the mobile VR porn anyways.
will this work in steam vr?
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.

Good one. Wondering how fashion startups like Dignyty.com  utilize VR to better match apparel  to prospective buyers.....
🐾
Oculus Go\nUne réduction de 50 % sur les prix courants\n2.5K display resolution. Hot! Good quality.  \nQuick to get it\nBefore the offer enters into force\n\nhttps://goo.gl/Ky53T4
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
Vr is dead. Stop already
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
Too bad vr sucks
Nobody cares about VR
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
VR is a disaster
OCULUS SUCKS, VIVE IS BETTER
By stand-alone I’m guessing it won’t need a PC or smartphone?
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
So will this be used for phones or what?
Wow look a waste of money!!!
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.
So no pc connection? What makes this better than my phone thrown in one of those google cardboard boxes for like 5 bucks max? I'm only here for the mobile VR porn anyways.
Will i able to buy this in or from Singapore??
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
$1000?
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
fuck facebook
Ricegum took the L
10/10 according to Edge! :O
Really dorky but I liked it.
This was a nice musical number. I haven't bought a nintendo console/game since the wii, would I buy a switch? It's still a maybe for me.
I would take this as a movie. A Mario musical based on this game. Sign me up.
But what about The Living Tombstone's remix?
There better be a dlc for just dance that has the Mario odyssey song, so I can finally learn how to do the Mario.
Been waiting for this ever since the day the song came out. No joke.
1 like=1 lesson about how to dance like Mario
This is OMG I love it
I'm Mexican and i love the Mexican Mario.
Man they are making it really hard not to buy a switch
anyone tried the demo? \nThe game Deserves all the hype
I really thought the guy in the couch was cnd
This is quite amazing is there a chance we can get them dancing in their fancy suites only really like to see the whole dance number
lel blue joy con= botw red joycon = mario odyssey\nthat would be a cool commercial
And i though Mario cant get better
Now THIS is advertising. None of that Wii U era nonsense.
Those of you who keep complaining that this is cringe, go look up The Legend of Zelda A link to the past SNES Japanese commercial...
Can’t get the song out of my head!
I will cleanse this COUNTRY from IMMIGRANTS with bleach by Kidnapping IMMIGRANTS and forcing them to drink BLECH!!! MwhA hahaha!!!
Well well well... Is time to get a switch.
Imagine this in japanese. Perfect op
This video has our childhood that we grew up with, will be a legend in our hearts. Thank you Nintendo for everything.
IM SO READY FOR THIS GAME TO BE OUT.
SOB this is what I've been asking for months!
I got a notification of this on my Wii U.
@ 1:21 I wonder if the fish swim away from you
Looks like mario needs to celebrate first before rescuing peach again XD
where is the green guy?
On of the reasons to be alive , just this
ODYSSEY YES SEE ODYSSEY YES SEE\nI HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HYPED FOR A FREAKIN VIDEO GAME BEFORE
Watching Mario dance like that reminds me of Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix. They should bring back that game it was fun and entertaining.
that's not new york, that's montevideo's city!!
Oh mario, back at it again with mind-controlling innocent kids.
Can’t wait for la la land 2 on The 27th
Something tells me that the game is going to be good
How marketing should be.
IS THIS GONNA BE A REAL MUSICAL IF YES COME TO THE NETHERLANDS URMERGURD 😱
This makes me so happy <3 <3 <3
All this promotion for a mario game and no demo on of the game on the eshop? This is unheard of
When's Mario Iliad coming out
Nintendo really did it with this one! This game is gonna be great!
Im a adult now, but i cant handle the hype, Mario is my hero
Nintendo please stop! I cant take all of this in at once, im dying, call 911, oml help
In still waiting for a sunshine 2 or a remaster. :/
Probably gonna be one of the best Mario games in a long time.
These ads have such an amazing amount of thought and charm into them, they make me so happy
Everyone knows women don't wear ties.
ive been listening to this all day! mario odyssey hype is real! thumbs up if you are READY TO JUMP UP YOU SUPERSTAR!
I have so much love for mario😍😍😍 #love4marioodyssey
So same game with possession powers added oh also newer graphics ?
This game looks sooooo good ya see (pun intended)
I would have liked to see them dance during the OdysSEY YESSY....... OdysSEY! YESSY! part, then my hype would have been built dancing along to the  music alone.
This songs reminds me that Christmas 2017 is coming....
I just came for the living tombstone...
1:24 I just love rewatching this part because of how happy the dinosaur looks walking around haha
Someone put scary music over this
10/10 cuz mario is still a dinosaur in this game
Seeing Mario take over real people's bodies is very creepy.\n\nAnd yet I still love him.
Now THIS is marketing
Oh boy, I love making head calls!
I'm vary existed for this game mama mia 2 more weeks!!! let's a go!! 😎😎😎😎
he still have the same yahoo i love lol😂
I need this game to live
On trending...\n\n\n\n\nThat's right
Nintendo please make a new zelda game for 3ds, it would be awesome if modern link was in it, or phantom hour glass/ wind waker link as well
0:26  YEAh THAT WAY!
Mario= bad hombre
My eyes are teary.
Nintendo is too cool.
i think i saw phantom r # rhythmthief2confirmed
#21 on trending oh yea hype for mario
Just Dance: Super Mario Edition
Pauline looks so hot.
Look at those shoes shine
My Boi
this is DOOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPEEEE <3 <3 <3
Just plain Awesome!
VIVA MEXICO :Y VIVA NINTENDO I buy súper Mario odyssey now.
Take the hint Broadway, Take the hint
10 outta 10 babyyyy
Yes yes YES!!!!!!!!!!!
1:05 yall know damn well why he ran
Pure nostalgia.
15 days OMGGGGGGG
do you even dab, super bro?
0:16 Super Mario 64 sound effects
WAO
0:37 Mario controls Mario. It's Marioception
booooooooo! wheres the 90's Mario!
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IT
How long before the SJW's make them take out Mexicano Mario?
game looks great. id stream it. BUUUUUUUUUT. yeah nintendo can take their profit share and shove it.
lots of yummy scrumptious looking white people :)
Why did Daisy get replaced by a real person?
Anyone bouncing on taxis like that would be in jail... just saying.
They really couldn't come up with better lyrics than odyssey yessey?
I think that is Keeley Bumford singing the song. not sure though. She did the singing for Bayonetta 2 which was great as well. Or at least it really sounds like her.
honestly who would want to play this ima stick with infante warfare
Nintendo is on fire making these awesome trailers!
Nintendo in 1986: let's make a Zelda rap \nNintendo in 2006: Orchestras for everything\nNintendo in 2015: 90s style music.\nNintendo in 2017: Jazz
Nintendo, why? Now I expect you to make a full musical on Mario Odyssey. You've raised the bar too much, and I don't appreciate that because I'm short. You need to lower it a bit so I can actually stand a chance at meeting any expectations. Looking forward to the game <3.
THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE THING
Tell me why the guy at the end sounds like he is wearing a retainer.
0:37 MARIO THAT IS A HUMAN PERSON DO NOT
I got this as an ad... so I watched the whole thing
What an awesome ad! \nMy whole family can't wait to play later this month!
AND LUIGI WERE IS LUIGI >:v
who's the girl?
I love this song
Im soo happy right now I cant stop smiling. Mario games are always been my childhood favorites. I luv you Nintendo!
Is this the ps4 trailer.
Mario Odyssey Is the true Odyssey
Why don't they have a Mario movie yet?
why did they pan the bass to the left in the song. feels off
Hmm... it’s fantastic!\nTho, Mario’s legs had a bit of trouble
This is marketing done right
I always wondered whatever happened to Carmen Sandiego.
This shows nintendo can pull of a live action film with an animated mario
Can’t wait for the game
They are going all nothing for 1 game
Are you going to make legend of Zelda again
So this is how Super Mario Odyssey looks on the ps4....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnah
God I wish I had a switch
But yet, how not many people have the switch like me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI LIVE A LIFE OF TORTURE WITHOUT IT
Am I the only one who thought persona when they heard the music?
When you thought Mario and the other people where dabing...\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANK LORD BOWSER
Can you guys make one with the whole song
Looks like they learned from their marketing mistakes from the wiiu
Dam Nintendo, even in a commercial you make everything look amazing
Between this and that Fire Emblem thing I'm really liking all the old school-style Nintendo live action shenanigans.
WHY IS THIS ANIMATION PIXAR-LEVEL QUALITY
Mario is old but he still got those dance moves :D
I grew out of mario and nintendo years ago, not my thing anymore...\n\n...but now i want a nintendo switch just for this game...
Im going to enjoy this game more than Zelda not really a huge Zelda fan no offensive
This needs to be in Just Dance 2018
This will be the best Mario game
I only have a Nintendo DS from 2006
1K Microsoft and Sony Fanboys triggered by how good this video is. 😂😂😂
This was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
0:33\nI've played Odyssey at a convention. The fact that this guy is running straight and not zigzagging is odd.
Super Mario Odyssey live musical please :)))))
0:30 Singing in the Rain -1952
looks like Mario droped the plumbing business for dancing
1:06 I love a crowd people are following him and he’s trying get away
This is so good I JUMP IN THE AIR Nintendo MY HAT IS OF TO YOU
at this point i've sold my soul to nintendo
Nintendo has gone maximum overdrive on us.
2ds mario's are a thing of the past.
I'm just gonna comment
This game looks very fun like it a mixture of games like Sonic Colors, Super Mario Sunshine, and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. I would buy it and I don't play a lot of Nintendo games; not saying Nintendo is bad because there amazing be personal I'm a Xbox and PC type of guy.
Rehearsal for opening summer olympics 2020 Tokyo!!!
Apparently, Mario is a mob leader in New York.
its was sick when Mario threw his hat and came out of nowhere
I WANT IT OUT NOW
Nintendo is determined to get every Switch owner to get this game the day it comes out. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I’m pretty most people were sold by the e3 trailer if they weren’t already from the Trailer at the Switch presentation
IT'S TIME TO JUMP UP IN THE AIR! DON'T BE SHY, DON'T BE SCARED BECAUSE I'LL BE YOUR 1 UP GIRL!
Mario is DANCING 11/10 video
looks better than sonic forces
미틴 짱이다 ㅋㅋ

*fills playlist with Mario oddessy remixes*
is it just me who thinks mario is overrated and dont give a flying f#ck about his games
Pure cringe
at 0:47, why are two people playing a single-player mario? \n\nEveryone in the comments seem to be raving about how amazing this looks...and I'm stuck here baffled at the blatant false advertisement....Two people controlling one Mario! PSH!
is it possible for you guys to make gta san andreis for nintendo switch
Your my favourite company ever! 👍👍👍 plz reply
Isn't the Pauline in this game marios sister
Do you have to legit flick the joycon? Cool
Whoever disliked this video has to have some sort of mental disorder.
can we all take a moment to appreciate the INSANE ANIMATION QUALITY.
really sad that iwata had to die before this masterpiece came along\nthanks iwata, see you next game.
Wow nintendo is back again with the over the top commercials...
That's some jojo poses my guy
Mario can dance better than all of us
Y Nintendo y?  Never make Mario dance again
BOI WE GUYS AND DOLLS NOW
0:35 when denis is playing  Super Mario Odyssey
Mario in real life sorta? Idk... I just don’t feel right...\nOverall this is a great game,\n\n\n\nGET IT? OVERALLS?
I would hug Mario if he was real. My ♥️in video games was because of him
All I need is good grades and I get $140 so I can buy this game, this is gonna be awesome.
Whoever disliked this wouldn't know good animation and music if it killed them.
Can't believe dog mario is real
OK IM CROSSING THE LINE AT MARIO DANCING AND POSSESSING RANDOM PEOPLE IN THE STREET
As Mario throws his hat taking control of your very soul forcing you to do unimaginable actions and framing you for countless murders as you can only sit there and watch as he uses your abilities to murder your friends and family and innocent people...
Super Mario Odyssey is not a musical
do you know gaming with kev
I can’t wait for super Mario oddessy 😁
Pauline please succ me\nMario please defeat all the jerks who disliked this

I wonder how hard it was for those actors to perfectly execute every action and dance move. There are some very talented people promoting a video game. Also the design of that Pauline dress was so spot on it HURTS. In short, this video must have been a total pain to make. Not to mention the editing and animation, now THAT'S true dedication.
Can we get a free public demo for Mario Oddessey Please
Everyone on the street looks like Michael Jackson. lolz
0:16 I haven't heard that mario voice clip since Mario 64. Nice throwback.
Parts of this sync really well with Bruno Mars' Treasure. Doesn't really matter, I just found it amusing.
like a mario game!!!!!!! all!!!!!!
Like for mario mexican
This game is going to be great! Keep it up Nintendo! (BTW I LOVE THIS SONG)
Woooh its comminggg AND I NOT HAVE A SWITCH :(
Only complaint I would have about this particular trailer is the lack of diversity--where are all the people of color? haha. Otherwise, great production value! Love the game and I love Nintendo. Can't wait!
On the thumbnail, i thought it was mario and michael jackson
TheLivingTombstone's remix of it tho....
Nintendo is going above and beyond in its marketing for both the console and more importantly the games and not only catering its advertising specifically to the Western market by making the product clearer, but insuring that whether or not we can play the game we can look forward to its release and share laughs and smiles with people who can play the game. The big N is back with a vengeance and ready to make all of us happy, whether we have to shell out to them or not.
This is Nintendo’s first step in movie production.
bet she can take a potato
Odyssey to the se! Ody-Wait...WHY so many dislikes ;-;.\n\nEdit:fixed grammar errors.And who’s hyped? :D
I just got enough money for the switch and didnt know how much i had, now i really wish i didnt spend like 150 already
I'll be sure we see Mario he's super.
I pre ordered this game i cant wait
When I saw the main trailer I thought that it was going to be boring but when I herd the song...😍😍
Imagine the luck of these dancers. Now they can put in their resumes that they danced a musical with Mario
I already know its going to be lit... But 13 more days :(
I'm adicitited to this song and the singer and Mario and the band and the color and the dance andeverything about the video
I would buy it if i had a switch
Cappy: Mario, aren't we suppose to be saving Pea-                                                                                                                                                            Mario: HUSH I WANT TO BE A SMOOTH CRIMINAL!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cappy: *sigh*
Ive never been so excited for a mario game or a mario musical before
This honestly has to be the best add I've seen
Anyone else think it looks like Mario is dabbing in the thumbnail with rest of the people?😂
mario it trash \nsonic is love
all i'm saying is where can i get one of em hats?!?! looks like it would help out enormously... #atthebackofthecoffeeline
I hope Luigi and some other characters can be playable at some point
0:21 look at Marios hair so detailed \n\nIs Mario old???
I can't wait till it comes out!!!😄😄😄😄
This game looks like it's going to be the ultimate Mario feel good adventure. I'm going to be having a grand 'ole time running around the worlds with my new best friend cappy. I also dig the Mario Party 2 vibes with all the costumes and such.
Who else wants a full length Super Mario Odyssey Musical now?
Wow, it looks WAY more realistic now! Damn!
why drive that scooter when you can posses the scooter
Two more weeks today.
Before I clicked this video, I thought it was going to be C R I N G É. \n\nIt turned out to be the B E S T video I’ve watched on YouTube this year!
if only Iwata was here to see how Nintendo is ruling 2017 :(
I added Tom Jones to it for you on my channel.
More of a Zelda fan myself, but dang man, I'm excited to play this.\nProbably haven't been this excited for a game since... Breath of the Wild... huh. Funny how that works out.
Tbh i dont realy like this i feel like mario should just die the time he was around was fun but this is too much and too long its getting boring and stupid all the work put in this amazing vid is fine but its just my opinion
Sonic: So Mario, How Does It Feel To Be Right Next To ACTUAL People?
Just a couple... more... weeks...
There is gonna be so much series of this when it comes out
Mario looks SO realistic
7k - Sonic & Sega Fans\n94k - Mario & Nintendo Fans
OMG mario looks so realistic 😀😀good job Nintendo
Cringe
#HYPE
RIP my money
Satoru Iwata would be proud.
Seems legit
Nintendo win everythink

Stop
AMAZING !
Am I the only one who noticed the girls at 0:48 where playing together?
0:48 two persons playing mario odissey?
SUPER MARIO BROADWAY SHOW \n\nIT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
When Nintendo releases a new game it's an EVENT
Do the Mario! Swing your arms from side to side\nCome on, it's time to go. Do the Mario!\nTake one step, and then again\nLet's do the Mario, all together now! You got it! It's the Mario! Do the Mario!\nSwing your arms from side to side\nCome on, it's time to go. Do the Mario!\nTake one step, and then again\nLet's do the Mario, all together now!\nCome on now. Just like that!
its that time of the year again. . .
That man was lucky enough to have Mario become one with him.
A fat midget dancing looks really dumb\nOh wait that’s mario
Mario looks good in a sombrero!
This is what should show up when you search suicide prevention
Wow,I didn't know that Mario could dance this great.
This song feels like a really good anime intro
I like how the original Donkey Kong theme is incorporated into this song.
Sonic is crap, I'm still a fan of Sonic but I prefer Mario over this
When mario's hat is more famous than he is, they make a game out of it.
I love you Nintendo I have all your consals
My dear Mario,what have they done to you
I like it but the dancing is ugly also I’m being mario for Halloween cause mario is amazing 🌝👌🏻
The trailer was so pretty my mom legitimately thought this was a movie trailer.
0:10 okay so they’re wondering what’s going on and then suddenly get possessed by “Mid-20th century song and dance” syndrome. Gotcha Nintendo
It would be funny if just a just dance game had this as a switch exclusive
I'm Flipping The Switch\n\nNintendo Switch is being Disbanded Confirmed
I love when Nintendo does stuff like this.
0:40 was the best part of the song imo
0:16 ahh... I remember that sound from super Mario 64
now this is how you make an ad
This is true beauty.
I like the music
7K people got their hat stomped on by Bowser.
I wish I could play that
the new mario 64 looks good
Whoops, 7k people missed the like button
Was anyone else thinking that if the ad 'took' inspiration from 'La La Land' it actually doesn't seem to really conflict with the 'cheeriness' of a Mario game?.
This music reminds me of super Mario land for some reason
Back to high quality commercials I see
I'm honestly floored at this musical actually made it to France as *the official TV advertisement.*
so broadway ,so new york, so la la land
I'm getting this game for Christmas
Mario obtained the power of possession
count on nintendo to have the most hear warming games ever
This song is actually lit af.
If this doesn't get in iTunes I'm gonna get cancer in my ear
Give me one reason why this won't be the game of the year.
Can this be the music for the game
Hey Nintendo why don't you do a new super smash bros for the Nintendo switch and 3DS
Sorry, those 7k dislikes were my neighbors. I was blasting this song all night. My bad.
Yet me still waiting for the newest 2d mario platform on the switch
Lets start the countdown to jurassic mushroom Kingdom (super Mario odyssey).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dance number still made it a pass and Mario rule 34 gets a pass to but Sonic rule 34 does not. Good thing Nintendo did not make a Photo realistic Mario. With sonic 06 was it weird to see a cartoonish hedgehog in a world of photorealistic humans not saying it's a bad thing but do some people like myself find it odd. Or not wereplumber\n\nI knew w in this game Mario is with humans but the game is still cartoonish unlike sonic 06
Great video! This has got me absolutely hyped for the upcoming game!
It's finally out.
This game and Stranger Things season 2 is coming out on the same day
The first time I seen this trailer, I thought to myself: is that the donkey Kong girl from the really old games of dk, OMG yes. did anybody else think that?
Wow look at 0:19 and look at the bottom right corner
Welcome to New York Normies
This should be on billboard top 100
Did anyone else spot the Odyssey at 1:11?
T h i s   i s   r e a l   m u s i c
This game is already a 10000000/10
Possibly the Nintendo's version of Grand Theft Auto.
MARLO is Cool and Good
Who thinks they should make a Super Mario Galaxy 3 after this?\n#SuperMarioGalaxy3
Nintendo must be on drugs cuz they have never been so good
I like how that they put 1950s theme to it
Time to ruin this song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎶 DO THE MARIO! SWING YOUR ARMS, FROM SIDE TO SIDE-🎵
I don't need it....\n*Good graphics*\nI don't need it....\n*Music with lyrics*\nI DEFINITELY don't need it....\n*Customize Mario's clothing*\nI don't need it....\n*Open world adventure*\nI don't need it....\n*Turn into anything using Cappy*\nI don't-\n*Pauline returns*\n...\nI NEEEEEEEED ITTTTTTTTT!!!!

AWESOME!
C'mon dab
Who tf dislikes this amazing video?
What.
My body and mind are ready for this game but my wallet isn't smh. 😔
cool game dont quit mario odssey
the video is cringe but the song is good
E10+ is a step in the right direction, not everyone that plays Nintendo are kids, 10 is still a kid, but you get the idea
Swing
The game looks great, but I'm  waiting for one playable character I'm looking forward too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*LUIGI*
👎👎👎👎
The dislikes are from Sony fans.
It’s like another super mario galaxy game kinda
All these kids with switches and I’m over here still begging
Can we plz take a moment to notice how hot that last in the red suit was?
Just realized, the people in this video are all white.
I'm just worried by taking it to a modern real world setting it would be bad. Just like what happened to Sonic... oh please prove me wrong!
Love how it makes you work for it honestly if I had money I'd get the skeleton key just to support you guys but I'm broke
What's the answer for 18

Finally!!  I'm curious, I bought the premium version on steam back when it very first came out with Nomad.  Am I going to have to buy it again?  Also, if I buy the Premium version on steam, do i also have to buy in on mobile or is there a way to link them?\n\nedit: for anyone wondering, they replied to me on Steam and said if you bought it on steam before, you do not have to buy it on steam again, but would have to buy it on the Apps since they are unable to link steam purchases with those.

Subscribe to Colin flaherty the truth
I'm going to guess the $1k PC or console and controllers aren't included at the price. :D
What can it run ? Can i run every Occulus Game on it ? I think not or ?
VR is barely scraping the market,so let's make a smaller, portable and expensive one!\nTaking tips from Sony - just like with the PSP
Pokemon Go hype didn't happen because of the word Go. Just saying.
Yeah but does it blend
Is trending just advertisements \nOr am i wrong
We are living in a simulation. Someone above us already invested this.
VR is nice and all, but I believe AR is much more accessible and sense-friendly in that you DON'T have to blind yourself to have a great experience. Not to mention I'm spooked by VR progressing beyond just a wearable screen and controllers.
I stopped liking this when I read from facebook.
Lets GET THIS TO #1 TRENDING BOI'S
Why is this on trending?
Go? Really? It's way to obvious why you chose that tag. You couldn't have done like oculus motion or literally any other word
Only $505165131651 get it now
lmao, 80,000 views and its 2nd on trending.Conservative videos reach billions in a day or so, only an hour on trending before its taken down. YouTube's Algorithm my ass
So electronic Velcro? What's with the random lights on the strap?
For 200 dollars more you can a legit VR headset... I mean I guess this is cool if all you want to do is watch some movies and sheeit or if you dont have a decent PC. The more people who experience VR the better widen the consumer base.
This doesn't tell me shit and why was it so loud
In 5 years this is going to be the equivalent of the big grey phone when cell phones first came out
Nope. Waiting for generation 10 at least.
Im so confused, what do it do? what are the features? a video about nothing...
But but I just got the new vr
So a rebranded gear VR that works on all phones... except iPhone of course
With the price it’s more like Oculus no
Not buying anything associated with Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg
wtf!? WHAT ABOUT MY OCULUS RIFT + TOUCH HEY WHAT THE FUCK WHERE ARE MY GAMES!
How about Oculus NO...\nhaha...\n.\nha\n.\n.\n. \n\nI'll leave
How about fixing your old s*** before you start making new.
Just wait till people will crash with this device:(.                               \n\n\n\n\nWhen you know your still going to use the Oculus Go when you drive
Some fucking dumbasses will crash their car while wearing this
Ah I just cracked my phone and than they make this why why
VR that’s no longer tethered to a PC will change the game, especially at the cheaper price. Wish the video released some specs though.
i feel that this device is just good enough for streaming video
Introduce the Camera you're using
How long until another company remakes this but changes it slightly and claims it as their own? Also without giving credit to oculus
Yay another shitty product so I can beat off in 3 dimensions
GOTTA OCULUS GO TO THE STORE NOW
That's pretty ok 👌
So.. I guess this is for those who absolutely cannot afford a smart phone or a decent PC? How would they spend $199 for VR? If this is an embedded hardware, it also means it is not expandable and will become obsolete faster than any other VR headsets.
Thx this is a must buy
So they made a portable version of something you need to be stationary to use...nice
Cool cool but what's the difference between this one and anyother?
So how do you catch pokemons with this?
This looks like a siege operator intro
What makes this different from the normal one? I didn’t get that from this trailer.
These are going to be amazing!  Can’t wait.
Lit. Now i can watch vr porn on the go!
yeah but why is this on trending
It's white so it's smarter 😉
I’m really into VR but I don’t get this
Now we just need oculus go to the polls
Reminds me of the Star Trek:TNG episode “The Game”\nhttps://youtu.be/ilIhdTG_UmQ
Now I can look like an even bigger tool in public.
Ha! April fools, you got me
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back. He shed his blood and sacrificied his life so we can be in heaven with him and the Lord! Turn away from your wicked ways and accept Jesus Christ as your SAVIOR!!! HE IS COMING AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR GO TO HELL. WOE ONTO YOU!!
can’t wait i’m about 15 years VR is gonna be way improved. And in 30 even more i feel like it’s inevitable.
I would love this if you could play games like Robo Recall on this, but alas you can't. So really this is like a gear vr. Still really cool and will buy because VR is still an overhyped/priced market.  $200 is nothing if its a premium product for low-end vr content.
37k views. How s this trending!!
PlayStation VR is still king, because you don't need a phone!!
Hope this leads to more porn VR videos being made  :)
Now i can watch porn wherever i want
Aye, something else I can’t afford....
Another spy tool from fakebook that will make us less sociable!! Sounds great!!
Dude I can’t wait to walk in the middle of the street with this shit my ni🅱️🅱️a
It's been a long time coming, and I'm hyped!
Exciting period for Oculus, the main culprit that VR is progressing slowly is the low resolution. Increase to 8k n above, 1 billion user will be in reach.
27 thousand views? Trending? No way Idubbz got 10 million views in one day, and trending never gave him anything
Oculus: Apple Edition

Cant wait, damn the negative replys...
Why is this on trending
So dank will buy again 18283828181/181822288282
So... Google Cardboard: Definitive Edition?
Don't know why some people complaining about Oculus Go.. This is GearVR level headset in just $200. You don't need to pay $800++ anymore. \nYes, it has no positional tracking, but this is only $200! Santa Cruz prototype will cost a lot more, you will see. \nP.s. I personaly will buy this just to watch movies in virtual cinema. For me it's dream come true..
For $200 I'm in.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
The VIVE is still better though o3o
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class
ELECTRONEUM... THE NEXT BITCOIN!?\n\nIt's worth buying at least $100 and see what happens.

Now fix your customer service department. It's rubbish
So, nobody’s gotten the memo that VR is a stupid gimmick? SadX
Can you watch porn on it, asking for a friend.
This thing better have a gtx 1080
https://youtu.be/Cm8V8TTJNpo Please support my MOVEMENT! 🔥🔥🔥💯 #Real
I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
VR is a disaster
What generation of iPhone is this?
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s
This came out the same day I got my oculus rift

WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it
GO? Go where? You're completely blind folded.
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain
Wow look a waste of money!!!
Will gangbang porn be better with these?
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
In portuguese Glass means Óculus. Oculos, get it?!
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
no more looking at your kids stupid faces in the car rides home
So will this be used for phones or what?
I don't get the on the go part?
Does it connect to steam?
and how to connect, wifi ?
Your move Vive. Let's have a full blown VR war that's actually affordable.
Ppl will think they can drive with them on
Vr is dead. Stop already
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
Fuck facebook, I will not give them a cent of my money. Garbage of a company.
If it is possible to connect it to my pc to it then I'm buying it
Cell phones are among the foulest items that are on this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they grow like fungus where it is decay, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a cell phone and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the cell phone will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.\n\n Arguably the scariest magical (technological) item of the your universe, a  cell phone feeds upon human happiness and leaves its victim in a state of depression and despair. The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth
Wait these guys aren't dead?
So basically Rick and Mortys vr thing

As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
At least Facebook is still trying.
$200?! I'm actually excited to get this
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.

will this work in steam vr?
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.

Oculus Go\nUne réduction de 50 % sur les prix courants\n2.5K display resolution. Hot! Good quality.  \nQuick to get it\nBefore the offer enters into force\n\nhttps://goo.gl/Ky53T4
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
Will Oculus Go support Home and Dash?
will this work in steam vr?
That’s fresh
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.
As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
At least Facebook is still trying.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
ELECTRONEUM... THE NEXT BITCOIN!?\n\nIt's worth buying at least $100 and see what happens. Many people wish they knew about Bitcoin before it took off! \n\nBitcoin started at $0.003 and is now over $5,000 each coin!\nThis new coin is in Pre-market Sale right now through October first. Offering an extra 10% bonus coins with each purchase! Coin sale is at $0.01 per Coin. Goes public on November 1st 2017. \n\nUse my link, when you buy, to get another 1% free coins:\n\nhttps://my.electroneum.com/join/43E7AC\n\nHit me up if you need help getting setup.\nTake advantage of this before you wish you had!
Now fix your customer service department. It's rubbish
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
So, nobody’s gotten the memo that VR is a stupid gimmick? SadX
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class
Can you watch porn on it, asking for a friend.
This thing better have a gtx 1080

I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
More like Oculus stop\n amirite guys \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a life
Why does the FCC have a say, when will they say, when will you sell. This advert is less than ideal.
This nigga still want a season 2 of Re:Zero?
I Love This Oculus Go Love It Hey, Everyone Cone And Check Out The Fastest Dancer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgA7YbvsYoc
White and fabric?  That's gonna get dirty too easily.  Especially if you're supposed to have it on the go.
Finially VR hentai games now available to the poor
My game is the best game
but can you use tilt brush, that is the real question
more like oculus go learn how to make a original joke
ok i really wanna buy the oculus rift but an someone explay this to me:\n1. i would like to walk in vr (just move a bit you know) is this possible with 1 camera? or 2?\n2. i saw that its possible to play htc vive games with the rift?? is that true and could someone (short) explain how?\nthank you!
WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it
GO? Go where? You're completely blind folded.
I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain
Will gangbang porn be better with these?
In portuguese Glass means Óculus. Oculos, get it?!
no more looking at your kids stupid faces in the car rides home
I don't get the on the go part?
$200?! I'm actually excited to get this
For $200 I'm in.
What generation of iPhone is this?
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s
This came out the same day I got my oculus rift
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
I need it!
Oculus Go *WASTE YOUR MONEY*
Wtf runs this thing
Why
Good job oculus!
two questions - weight & battery lifetime?
Anyone reminded of Amusphere from SAO
Wait these guys aren't dead?
So basically Rick and Mortys vr thing
No positional tracking means this headset will suck

No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
Vr is dead. Stop already
Wow look a waste of money!!!
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
Will i able to buy this in or from Singapore??
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.
Too bad vr sucks
Nobody cares about VR
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
VR is a disaster
OCULUS SUCKS, VIVE IS BETTER
By stand-alone I’m guessing it won’t need a PC or smartphone?
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
So will this be used for phones or what?
So no pc connection? What makes this better than my phone thrown in one of those google cardboard boxes for like 5 bucks max? I'm only here for the mobile VR porn anyways.
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
$1000?

Ricegum took the L
10/10 according to Edge! :O
Really dorky but I liked it.
This was a nice musical number. I haven't bought a nintendo console/game since the wii, would I buy a switch? It's still a maybe for me.
I would take this as a movie. A Mario musical based on this game. Sign me up.
But what about The Living Tombstone's remix?
There better be a dlc for just dance that has the Mario odyssey song, so I can finally learn how to do the Mario.
Been waiting for this ever since the day the song came out. No joke.
1 like=1 lesson about how to dance like Mario
This is OMG I love it
I'm Mexican and i love the Mexican Mario.
Man they are making it really hard not to buy a switch
anyone tried the demo? \nThe game Deserves all the hype
I really thought the guy in the couch was cnd
This is quite amazing is there a chance we can get them dancing in their fancy suites only really like to see the whole dance number
lel blue joy con= botw red joycon = mario odyssey\nthat would be a cool commercial
And i though Mario cant get better
Now THIS is advertising. None of that Wii U era nonsense.
Those of you who keep complaining that this is cringe, go look up The Legend of Zelda A link to the past SNES Japanese commercial...
Can’t get the song out of my head!
I will cleanse this COUNTRY from IMMIGRANTS with bleach by Kidnapping IMMIGRANTS and forcing them to drink BLECH!!! MwhA hahaha!!!
Well well well... Is time to get a switch.
Imagine this in japanese. Perfect op
This video has our childhood that we grew up with, will be a legend in our hearts. Thank you Nintendo for everything.
IM SO READY FOR THIS GAME TO BE OUT.
SOB this is what I've been asking for months!
I got a notification of this on my Wii U.
@ 1:21 I wonder if the fish swim away from you
Looks like mario needs to celebrate first before rescuing peach again XD
where is the green guy?
On of the reasons to be alive , just this
ODYSSEY YES SEE ODYSSEY YES SEE\nI HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HYPED FOR A FREAKIN VIDEO GAME BEFORE
Watching Mario dance like that reminds me of Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix. They should bring back that game it was fun and entertaining.
that's not new york, that's montevideo's city!!
Oh mario, back at it again with mind-controlling innocent kids.
Can’t wait for la la land 2 on The 27th
Something tells me that the game is going to be good
How marketing should be.
IS THIS GONNA BE A REAL MUSICAL IF YES COME TO THE NETHERLANDS URMERGURD 😱
This makes me so happy <3 <3 <3
All this promotion for a mario game and no demo on of the game on the eshop? This is unheard of
When's Mario Iliad coming out
Nintendo really did it with this one! This game is gonna be great!
Im a adult now, but i cant handle the hype, Mario is my hero
Nintendo please stop! I cant take all of this in at once, im dying, call 911, oml help
In still waiting for a sunshine 2 or a remaster. :/
Probably gonna be one of the best Mario games in a long time.
These ads have such an amazing amount of thought and charm into them, they make me so happy
Everyone knows women don't wear ties.
ive been listening to this all day! mario odyssey hype is real! thumbs up if you are READY TO JUMP UP YOU SUPERSTAR!
I have so much love for mario😍😍😍 #love4marioodyssey
So same game with possession powers added oh also newer graphics ?
This game looks sooooo good ya see (pun intended)
I would have liked to see them dance during the OdysSEY YESSY....... OdysSEY! YESSY! part, then my hype would have been built dancing along to the  music alone.
This songs reminds me that Christmas 2017 is coming....
I just came for the living tombstone...
1:24 I just love rewatching this part because of how happy the dinosaur looks walking around haha
Someone put scary music over this
10/10 cuz mario is still a dinosaur in this game
Seeing Mario take over real people's bodies is very creepy.\n\nAnd yet I still love him.
Now THIS is marketing
Oh boy, I love making head calls!
I'm vary existed for this game mama mia 2 more weeks!!! let's a go!! 😎😎😎😎
he still have the same yahoo i love lol😂
I need this game to live
On trending...\n\n\n\n\nThat's right
Nintendo please make a new zelda game for 3ds, it would be awesome if modern link was in it, or phantom hour glass/ wind waker link as well
0:26  YEAh THAT WAY!
Mario= bad hombre
My eyes are teary.
Nintendo is too cool.
i think i saw phantom r # rhythmthief2confirmed
#21 on trending oh yea hype for mario

Take the hint Broadway, Take the hint
10 outta 10 babyyyy
Yes yes YES!!!!!!!!!!!
1:05 yall know damn well why he ran
Pure nostalgia.

I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IT
How long before the SJW's make them take out Mexicano Mario?
game looks great. id stream it. BUUUUUUUUUT. yeah nintendo can take their profit share and shove it.
lots of yummy scrumptious looking white people :)
Why did Daisy get replaced by a real person?
Anyone bouncing on taxis like that would be in jail... just saying.
They really couldn't come up with better lyrics than odyssey yessey?
I think that is Keeley Bumford singing the song. not sure though. She did the singing for Bayonetta 2 which was great as well. Or at least it really sounds like her.
honestly who would want to play this ima stick with infante warfare
Nintendo is on fire making these awesome trailers!
Nintendo in 1986: let's make a Zelda rap \nNintendo in 2006: Orchestras for everything\nNintendo in 2015: 90s style music.\nNintendo in 2017: Jazz
Nintendo, why? Now I expect you to make a full musical on Mario Odyssey. You've raised the bar too much, and I don't appreciate that because I'm short. You need to lower it a bit so I can actually stand a chance at meeting any expectations. Looking forward to the game <3.
THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE THING
Tell me why the guy at the end sounds like he is wearing a retainer.
0:37 MARIO THAT IS A HUMAN PERSON DO NOT
I got this as an ad... so I watched the whole thing
What an awesome ad! \nMy whole family can't wait to play later this month!
AND LUIGI WERE IS LUIGI >:v
who's the girl?
I love this song
Im soo happy right now I cant stop smiling. Mario games are always been my childhood favorites. I luv you Nintendo!
Is this the ps4 trailer.
Mario Odyssey Is the true Odyssey
Why don't they have a Mario movie yet?
why did they pan the bass to the left in the song. feels off
Hmm... it’s fantastic!\nTho, Mario’s legs had a bit of trouble
This is marketing done right
I always wondered whatever happened to Carmen Sandiego.
This shows nintendo can pull of a live action film with an animated mario
Can’t wait for the game
They are going all nothing for 1 game
Are you going to make legend of Zelda again
So this is how Super Mario Odyssey looks on the ps4....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnah
God I wish I had a switch
But yet, how not many people have the switch like me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI LIVE A LIFE OF TORTURE WITHOUT IT
Am I the only one who thought persona when they heard the music?
When you thought Mario and the other people where dabing...\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANK LORD BOWSER
Can you guys make one with the whole song
Looks like they learned from their marketing mistakes from the wiiu
Dam Nintendo, even in a commercial you make everything look amazing
Between this and that Fire Emblem thing I'm really liking all the old school-style Nintendo live action shenanigans.
WHY IS THIS ANIMATION PIXAR-LEVEL QUALITY
Mario is old but he still got those dance moves :D
I grew out of mario and nintendo years ago, not my thing anymore...\n\n...but now i want a nintendo switch just for this game...
Im going to enjoy this game more than Zelda not really a huge Zelda fan no offensive
This needs to be in Just Dance 2018
This will be the best Mario game
I only have a Nintendo DS from 2006
1K Microsoft and Sony Fanboys triggered by how good this video is. 😂😂😂
This was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
0:33\nI've played Odyssey at a convention. The fact that this guy is running straight and not zigzagging is odd.
Super Mario Odyssey live musical please :)))))
0:30 Singing in the Rain -1952
looks like Mario droped the plumbing business for dancing
1:06 I love a crowd people are following him and he’s trying get away
This is so good I JUMP IN THE AIR Nintendo MY HAT IS OF TO YOU
at this point i've sold my soul to nintendo
Nintendo has gone maximum overdrive on us.
2ds mario's are a thing of the past.
I'm just gonna comment
This game looks very fun like it a mixture of games like Sonic Colors, Super Mario Sunshine, and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. I would buy it and I don't play a lot of Nintendo games; not saying Nintendo is bad because there amazing be personal I'm a Xbox and PC type of guy.
Rehearsal for opening summer olympics 2020 Tokyo!!!
Apparently, Mario is a mob leader in New York.
its was sick when Mario threw his hat and came out of nowhere
I WANT IT OUT NOW
Nintendo is determined to get every Switch owner to get this game the day it comes out. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I’m pretty most people were sold by the e3 trailer if they weren’t already from the Trailer at the Switch presentation
IT'S TIME TO JUMP UP IN THE AIR! DON'T BE SHY, DON'T BE SCARED BECAUSE I'LL BE YOUR 1 UP GIRL!
Mario is DANCING 11/10 video
looks better than sonic forces

is it just me who thinks mario is overrated and dont give a flying f#ck about his games
Pure cringe
at 0:47, why are two people playing a single-player mario? \n\nEveryone in the comments seem to be raving about how amazing this looks...and I'm stuck here baffled at the blatant false advertisement....Two people controlling one Mario! PSH!
is it possible for you guys to make gta san andreis for nintendo switch
Your my favourite company ever! 👍👍👍 plz reply
Isn't the Pauline in this game marios sister
Do you have to legit flick the joycon? Cool
Whoever disliked this video has to have some sort of mental disorder.
can we all take a moment to appreciate the INSANE ANIMATION QUALITY.
really sad that iwata had to die before this masterpiece came along\nthanks iwata, see you next game.
Wow nintendo is back again with the over the top commercials...
That's some jojo poses my guy
Mario can dance better than all of us
Y Nintendo y?  Never make Mario dance again
BOI WE GUYS AND DOLLS NOW

Mario in real life sorta? Idk... I just don’t feel right...\nOverall this is a great game,\n\n\n\nGET IT? OVERALLS?
I would hug Mario if he was real. My ♥️in video games was because of him
All I need is good grades and I get $140 so I can buy this game, this is gonna be awesome.
Whoever disliked this wouldn't know good animation and music if it killed them.
Can't believe dog mario is real
OK IM CROSSING THE LINE AT MARIO DANCING AND POSSESSING RANDOM PEOPLE IN THE STREET
As Mario throws his hat taking control of your very soul forcing you to do unimaginable actions and framing you for countless murders as you can only sit there and watch as he uses your abilities to murder your friends and family and innocent people...
Super Mario Odyssey is not a musical
do you know gaming with kev
I can’t wait for super Mario oddessy 😁
Pauline please succ me\nMario please defeat all the jerks who disliked this

I wonder how hard it was for those actors to perfectly execute every action and dance move. There are some very talented people promoting a video game. Also the design of that Pauline dress was so spot on it HURTS. In short, this video must have been a total pain to make. Not to mention the editing and animation, now THAT'S true dedication.
Can we get a free public demo for Mario Oddessey Please
Everyone on the street looks like Michael Jackson. lolz
0:16 I haven't heard that mario voice clip since Mario 64. Nice throwback.
Parts of this sync really well with Bruno Mars' Treasure. Doesn't really matter, I just found it amusing.
like a mario game!!!!!!! all!!!!!!
Like for mario mexican
This game is going to be great! Keep it up Nintendo! (BTW I LOVE THIS SONG)
Woooh its comminggg AND I NOT HAVE A SWITCH :(
Only complaint I would have about this particular trailer is the lack of diversity--where are all the people of color? haha. Otherwise, great production value! Love the game and I love Nintendo. Can't wait!
On the thumbnail, i thought it was mario and michael jackson
TheLivingTombstone's remix of it tho....
Nintendo is going above and beyond in its marketing for both the console and more importantly the games and not only catering its advertising specifically to the Western market by making the product clearer, but insuring that whether or not we can play the game we can look forward to its release and share laughs and smiles with people who can play the game. The big N is back with a vengeance and ready to make all of us happy, whether we have to shell out to them or not.
This is Nintendo’s first step in movie production.
bet she can take a potato
Odyssey to the se! Ody-Wait...WHY so many dislikes ;-;.\n\nEdit:fixed grammar errors.And who’s hyped? :D
I just got enough money for the switch and didnt know how much i had, now i really wish i didnt spend like 150 already
I'll be sure we see Mario he's super.
I pre ordered this game i cant wait
When I saw the main trailer I thought that it was going to be boring but when I herd the song...😍😍
Imagine the luck of these dancers. Now they can put in their resumes that they danced a musical with Mario
I already know its going to be lit... But 13 more days :(
I'm adicitited to this song and the singer and Mario and the band and the color and the dance andeverything about the video
I would buy it if i had a switch
Cappy: Mario, aren't we suppose to be saving Pea-                                                                                                                                                            Mario: HUSH I WANT TO BE A SMOOTH CRIMINAL!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cappy: *sigh*
Ive never been so excited for a mario game or a mario musical before
This honestly has to be the best add I've seen
Anyone else think it looks like Mario is dabbing in the thumbnail with rest of the people?😂
mario it trash \nsonic is love
all i'm saying is where can i get one of em hats?!?! looks like it would help out enormously... #atthebackofthecoffeeline
I hope Luigi and some other characters can be playable at some point
0:21 look at Marios hair so detailed \n\nIs Mario old???
I can't wait till it comes out!!!😄😄😄😄
This game looks like it's going to be the ultimate Mario feel good adventure. I'm going to be having a grand 'ole time running around the worlds with my new best friend cappy. I also dig the Mario Party 2 vibes with all the costumes and such.
Who else wants a full length Super Mario Odyssey Musical now?
Wow, it looks WAY more realistic now! Damn!
why drive that scooter when you can posses the scooter
Two more weeks today.
Before I clicked this video, I thought it was going to be C R I N G É. \n\nIt turned out to be the B E S T video I’ve watched on YouTube this year!
if only Iwata was here to see how Nintendo is ruling 2017 :(
I added Tom Jones to it for you on my channel.
More of a Zelda fan myself, but dang man, I'm excited to play this.\nProbably haven't been this excited for a game since... Breath of the Wild... huh. Funny how that works out.
Tbh i dont realy like this i feel like mario should just die the time he was around was fun but this is too much and too long its getting boring and stupid all the work put in this amazing vid is fine but its just my opinion
Sonic: So Mario, How Does It Feel To Be Right Next To ACTUAL People?
Just a couple... more... weeks...
There is gonna be so much series of this when it comes out
Mario looks SO realistic
7k - Sonic & Sega Fans\n94k - Mario & Nintendo Fans
OMG mario looks so realistic 😀😀good job Nintendo
Cringe
#HYPE
RIP my money
Satoru Iwata would be proud.
Seems legit

Am I the only one who noticed the girls at 0:48 where playing together?
0:48 two persons playing mario odissey?
SUPER MARIO BROADWAY SHOW \n\nIT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
When Nintendo releases a new game it's an EVENT
Do the Mario! Swing your arms from side to side\nCome on, it's time to go. Do the Mario!\nTake one step, and then again\nLet's do the Mario, all together now! You got it! It's the Mario! Do the Mario!\nSwing your arms from side to side\nCome on, it's time to go. Do the Mario!\nTake one step, and then again\nLet's do the Mario, all together now!\nCome on now. Just like that!
its that time of the year again. . .
That man was lucky enough to have Mario become one with him.
A fat midget dancing looks really dumb\nOh wait that’s mario
Mario looks good in a sombrero!
This is what should show up when you search suicide prevention
Wow,I didn't know that Mario could dance this great.
This song feels like a really good anime intro
I like how the original Donkey Kong theme is incorporated into this song.
Sonic is crap, I'm still a fan of Sonic but I prefer Mario over this
When mario's hat is more famous than he is, they make a game out of it.
I love you Nintendo I have all your consals
My dear Mario,what have they done to you
I like it but the dancing is ugly also I’m being mario for Halloween cause mario is amazing 🌝👌🏻
The trailer was so pretty my mom legitimately thought this was a movie trailer.
0:10 okay so they’re wondering what’s going on and then suddenly get possessed by “Mid-20th century song and dance” syndrome. Gotcha Nintendo
It would be funny if just a just dance game had this as a switch exclusive
I'm Flipping The Switch\n\nNintendo Switch is being Disbanded Confirmed
I love when Nintendo does stuff like this.
0:40 was the best part of the song imo
0:16 ahh... I remember that sound from super Mario 64
now this is how you make an ad
This is true beauty.
I like the music
7K people got their hat stomped on by Bowser.
I wish I could play that
the new mario 64 looks good
Whoops, 7k people missed the like button
Was anyone else thinking that if the ad 'took' inspiration from 'La La Land' it actually doesn't seem to really conflict with the 'cheeriness' of a Mario game?.
This music reminds me of super Mario land for some reason
Back to high quality commercials I see
I'm honestly floored at this musical actually made it to France as *the official TV advertisement.*
so broadway ,so new york, so la la land
I'm getting this game for Christmas
Mario obtained the power of possession
count on nintendo to have the most hear warming games ever
This song is actually lit af.
If this doesn't get in iTunes I'm gonna get cancer in my ear
Give me one reason why this won't be the game of the year.
Can this be the music for the game
Hey Nintendo why don't you do a new super smash bros for the Nintendo switch and 3DS
Sorry, those 7k dislikes were my neighbors. I was blasting this song all night. My bad.
Yet me still waiting for the newest 2d mario platform on the switch
Lets start the countdown to jurassic mushroom Kingdom (super Mario odyssey).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dance number still made it a pass and Mario rule 34 gets a pass to but Sonic rule 34 does not. Good thing Nintendo did not make a Photo realistic Mario. With sonic 06 was it weird to see a cartoonish hedgehog in a world of photorealistic humans not saying it's a bad thing but do some people like myself find it odd. Or not wereplumber\n\nI knew w in this game Mario is with humans but the game is still cartoonish unlike sonic 06
Great video! This has got me absolutely hyped for the upcoming game!
It's finally out.
This game and Stranger Things season 2 is coming out on the same day
The first time I seen this trailer, I thought to myself: is that the donkey Kong girl from the really old games of dk, OMG yes. did anybody else think that?
Wow look at 0:19 and look at the bottom right corner
Welcome to New York Normies
This should be on billboard top 100
Did anyone else spot the Odyssey at 1:11?
T h i s   i s   r e a l   m u s i c
This game is already a 10000000/10
Possibly the Nintendo's version of Grand Theft Auto.
MARLO is Cool and Good
Who thinks they should make a Super Mario Galaxy 3 after this?\n#SuperMarioGalaxy3
Nintendo must be on drugs cuz they have never been so good
I like how that they put 1950s theme to it
Time to ruin this song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎶 DO THE MARIO! SWING YOUR ARMS, FROM SIDE TO SIDE-🎵
I don't need it....\n*Good graphics*\nI don't need it....\n*Music with lyrics*\nI DEFINITELY don't need it....\n*Customize Mario's clothing*\nI don't need it....\n*Open world adventure*\nI don't need it....\n*Turn into anything using Cappy*\nI don't-\n*Pauline returns*\n...\nI NEEEEEEEED ITTTTTTTTT!!!!

Whhhhhooooaaaaa! *internal fangirling*
AWESOME!
C'mon dab
Who tf dislikes this amazing video?
What.
My body and mind are ready for this game but my wallet isn't smh. 😔
cool game dont quit mario odssey
the video is cringe but the song is good
E10+ is a step in the right direction, not everyone that plays Nintendo are kids, 10 is still a kid, but you get the idea
Swing
The game looks great, but I'm  waiting for one playable character I'm looking forward too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*LUIGI*
👎👎👎👎
The dislikes are from Sony fans.
It’s like another super mario galaxy game kinda
All these kids with switches and I’m over here still begging
Can we plz take a moment to notice how hot that last in the red suit was?
Just realized, the people in this video are all white.
I'm just worried by taking it to a modern real world setting it would be bad. Just like what happened to Sonic... oh please prove me wrong!
Love how it makes you work for it honestly if I had money I'd get the skeleton key just to support you guys but I'm broke
What's the answer for 18

Finally!!  I'm curious, I bought the premium version on steam back when it very first came out with Nomad.  Am I going to have to buy it again?  Also, if I buy the Premium version on steam, do i also have to buy in on mobile or is there a way to link them?\n\nedit: for anyone wondering, they replied to me on Steam and said if you bought it on steam before, you do not have to buy it on steam again, but would have to buy it on the Apps since they are unable to link steam purchases with those.

The second I read this title in my notification, I started to giggle.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I respectfully disagree with people about a cats  independence/pride not having value in a support class. Yes dogs builds can do many things for humans that cats builds will never be able to do but how much is that needed by the average human overall? Dogs unfortunately need a huge amount of  maintenance daily and otherwise.\n1 food\n2 grooming, \n3 walks\n4 training\n5  space\n6 healthcare\n7 entertainment  \n8 affection \n9 time \nall this can be quit daunting to a human who just needs a moral boost and/ or some cuddling but  not so much time to support a support class. this make the cat a great choice for many stressed overworked people.\ncats do need daily maintenance but compared to the dog there is no contest.\n\n1 food independence bonus!If outdoors cat build may find food and feed themselves \n2 grooming independence bonus self grooming! *not all build types apply recommend scratch post for nail care to nullify the home degrade from cat scratch.  \n3 walks  independence bonus self walking human not needed\n4 training independence penalty! you want me do what? f that I ain't your slave. independence bonus No potty training needed! If i hide my waste in this sandbox no one will ever  know  \n5 space 'independence bonus! yard not needed\n6 healthcare needs same support \n7entertaninmet needs same support\n8 affection needs same support\n9 time independence bonus flexible time needs! time reduction up to 50% or more!
Cats vs Dogs? You mean BB gun vs M16?
if toxiplasmosis is as strong as you say, why is it that you give all of the credit to the dog class and none to the cat class?\n\nI wonder if dogs have a hidden status effect that caused the imbalance in this video :thinking:
How would one go about a meerkat build?
You are a dog person eh?  Cats help with mice and vermin by removing them from the area (saving food stores), and provide a healing buff with a purr move.... this creates a regen that affects the cat and any creature in contact with it.  I hope you see this because the purr move is the only reason why I spec'd my noobs as cat builds.  Dog builds do not have any regen abilities... and they require more effort out of players that spec'd as human.
Can we get an arachnid video?
Can you do a video on the Kangaroo class? I feel like it’s a good class but I just don’t know how to use it well.
.. I love this so much....how did I never know these existed? And I'm sporting Cat x3 + Dog x1 +... wait do pet turkey's count? They're wild but I feed them occasionally...
Every person that wants him to be biased to cats: HE'S BIASED TOWARDS DOGS, CATS HAVE SAVED HUMANS FROM INTRUDERS IN 2 CASES IN HISTORY AND COMAS!!!!!I!I!III!!II
Does that make the cat a parasite?
How should I go about building my bacteria class?
Can you do a tier list on the ants. The one species that is everywhere you go no matter what
Since Halloween is coming up could you talk about the controversial Ghost builds?
Could you talk about the bear class?
I think this video is a tad bias,  but it's ok. Adblock😎
so... cats are too good at other things to be the true best support class.
I thought this was for real life, then I thought he was talking about a video game, then then I thought he was talking about real life in a video game... I’m so confuzzled
Why was the snake not listed in the human support tier list?  Are you saying snakes aren't real pets?  But IDC, it's still a great video!
Im glad such a unique underated channel is getting some spotlight and is tending.
Id like to know more about the leaf cutter or ant meta in general
A video about owl would help out my dumbass brother who only plays crazy offensive builds
Are you this old YouTuber called antvenom?
I'm a goat build, trying to go for that mountain goat doe, need to level up my legs and my hooves i think, can you help me? i don't really know.
When everyone gets salty because the cats aren't the strongest support class.
What the fuck is going on in this video?
What about the tier list for the North American server?
You need to remember pure support classes. Cats and dogs can both play independent of humans but what about classes that support the microbiome? Humans can survive without cats dogs and other macro-scale classes but micro-scale classes are inherently necessary to their continued dominance. Of course this also affects most other players in the entire game from micro to macro so if you're analyzing around the human perspective then perhaps it's not necessary to highlight, but it's important to remember that these classes form the backbone of any and all macro-scale strategies.
True pro humans have both cats and dogs as supports. Lots of maintenance, but the payoff is ridiculous.
Do a video on the Axolotl
I still like cats
Man, the salt from catfuckers is glorious. Can't even handle shitposting if it mentions the catshit from which toxo plasmosis is spread.
Talk to me when you make a dragon guide, smh to many plebs maxing fire breathe everyone knows you max wings then scales then fire
Great content! Support classes are among my favorites.\n\nCould you explore the current rodent meta?  There are a lot of interesting and diverse specialized builds, considering they almost uniformly revolve around the (probably OP) constantly growing incisors.  \n\nAlso, how are capybara players able to spec into such a unique ability as serenity aura?  They can befriend other players with startling ease.  Is there some wololo ayoyoyo at work, or is this just playstyle?  Inquiring minds want to know.
Hey, a friend of mine swears by the tarantula specs, but I'm not sure I'm sold on the arachnid guild or if I can get past how creepy it would look. Is a arachnid build really viable?
Now let's talk about the worst class\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman,i mean we smart but not smart enough to figure out that we should stop killing each other damn griefers(also human builds have a load of debuffs)
You should do one based on some of the stranger characters like say duck-billed platypus,  Narwals, Sea Pigs,  anything else thats just kinda bizarre
love the use of the dont starve sound track
Talk about the best survival builds
First time here and its great
So glad that your videos made it to trending so that other people can see your beautiful work, keep it going man 👍
The price hike for Daraprim was for insurance companies. People can get it for really cheap.
I'd like to see you cover the banning of the Dodo Bird, it's something I don't know much about and would love to hear your take on it.
What about ranged classes? \n\n\nEtc spitting cobras spray venom to their opponent causing victims health to keep draining until death unless the opponent is too big which is usually not the case because in the desert servers (which is where they live) the opponents are usually small enough for death usually that's their main attack but if that doesn't work they aren't afraid to bite you with the same effects \n\n\n\nElement venom \nIntelligence: 40\nStealth: 70\nDefence-low (but high for its size) so: 20\nSpeed- once again low (but high for its size): 30\nHP:20\n\nAnother ranged class is the Egyptian vulture.\nEgyptian vultures pick up rocks into the air using the move flight which utilizes the air element to lift it up in the air.After the vultures pick up the stones in the air they drop the stones on eggs (an earth element move) with tough shells killing their opponents before the baby stage reducing competition but the vultures had to develop high intelligence for that sometimes they just pick up the stone and start hammering at the egg without even flying into the air.\n\nSpeed:80\nStealth:80\nAttack:30\nDefence:25\nIntelligence:80\nHP:30
Can you mention Axolotl mains and give them a few pointers? I'm not one, but I was considering wiping my previous account as a fox to try something with better health retention.
Everyone’s joking about having real classes while I’m still sitting here scarred by the dogs and cats friggin murdering anything they see
This video is on trending! Well deserved, it will get more subs! I subbed when the channel had ~15k subs. 👌
What tier is best for jungle?
Cats are the embodiement of PvP players. Selfish as hell and cheat wherever they can. Dogs form thier APvP guild to contain the cats, then get baged by dog catchers. Wow games really do model real life sometimes.
I've been looking forward to your analysis of dogs since your first video
Talk about the platypus (also I think you could revisit this topic)
You should look into the balancing of different reproductive systems. Seems completely unbalanced that some classes have to camp their own spawn point to defend against griefers for months just because they have the egg skill tree when others get the incredibly easy budding ability.
Hey so are you ever gonna cover how massively unbalanced the Human players are? When are they gonna get nerfed? They are basically playing their own game at this point.
Will you make a video discussing the importance of the defensive meta and name some specific animals that follow this build?
So dogs are good for combo attacks and cats are the healers so cats are mercy(I think that's the healers name I don't know lol)and dogs are bastion,mcree and sometimes genji
This is why I don't raid with cats, Their toxoplasma parasite infects the group as well as the main boss which leads to unfair distribution of DKP. Always in their favor :(
Blue collar humans and White collar humans
What if the devs make a Mars expansion pack? Which tiers will do well on that map?
Since you did big cats can you do canines too? I know hyenas are more related to cats but could you add em in too if you do? Thanks LOVE YOUR VIDS
Mitochondria are the best support class. Nobody in there right mind would play without one on there team.
For the dog you forgot about recognizing invisible desieses and alerting their handler
I think it's time for a video on the number 1 undisputed SSS tier human, perhaps a  light recap of guild conflicts would be interesting (tier history series when??)
#17 Trending. Congrats for making it, and definitely lookong forawrd to what's next.
Dogs: Look at this team! We're gonna do great!\n\nCats; I need healing!
Cats have some of the best escape in the game in their climbing ability and acrobatic movement.\nBeing unable to reach the same levels of pure physical power doesn't matter because a cat can simply escape whenever its in a bad matchup, unlike a dog.
When you realize you're #20 on trending, wow great moves keep it up proud of you
i don't believe in the conspiracy, it might play a small part  but its probably cats because tribes helped them cause the kill mice that eat grain, so they were a support class but not any more.
Can you explain what the hell is going on with the great Potoo?
I’m a fox main and some of us in the community have managed to befriend humans
Nigga talking about it like life a game😂
Are jellyfish viable?
#22 on trending! Congrats

I have a problem. I initially thought being a fish player was a good idea, but ultimately decided to make a switch. I want to make a switch to Megatherium, but my game always seems to crash when I try. I was wondering if you could make a video going over how to build with Sloths, or even how to build with the Megatherium (if my game stops crashing when I try to make one.) It would be incredibly helpful.
It's so obvious when someone is a dog main. :/\n\nCooking up conspiracy theories for why cats are such a high-ranked support class when even back in pre-release, cats remain THE most effective check for griefing mouse, rat, bird, mole, and even some lizard builds. Human players aren't really specced to handle those classes, never have been. For one thing, the larger build size of humans making it easy for smaller builds like the rodent class to easily evade them by retreating to terrain where bigger builds can't follow, allowing them to actually establish spawn points within a human player's territory and also sneak into human bases and steal valuable drops and resources directly from their storage containers. Plus, humans just dumped way too many stats into INT and its skill trees, and failed to go deep enough into the Perception skill tree to pick up on the heightened hearing, sense of smell, or even night vision perks that would help negate the lower tier classes' ability to grief them. Yeah, humans may dominate the current meta in terms of their influence on the meta itself, but the fact is that there will always be a thousand low-level players for every high-level one - and if the low-level players can grief the high-level players through sheer numbers, without being checked, that gradual erosion on the high tier player is going to start showing more and more of an effect.\n\nEnter, my friends, the cat class.\n\nThe cat class, as you noted, never made the switch from their assassin role to a support role. Why, then, are they considered a S tier support class? It's simple - the cat class never made the switch to a support role because it didn't need to. Its abilities as a stealth assassin class are exactly what human players needed, and so human players started pairing with cat players exactly as they were. The cat class comes STANDARD with all the abilities required to handle the numerous low-tier griefers that human players simply aren't equipped to, and any cat player playing solo will already BE tackling those griefers because it's the most logical, natural playstyle for anyone who specs into the class to begin with. What else are you going to do with all those stealth and attack points, especially at that build size? And then a human player comes along, sees what your class can do(that theirs can't, but desperately needs), and offers you a mutually beneficial arrangement where it shares its resources with you, in exchange for your doing exactly what you were already doing - just in their territory. Like I said, you can look back through past versions of the game all the way back to pre-1.0 and see this logic at work, with cat and human players teaming up as early as the Ancient Egyptian expansion.\n\nAnd all this is talking purely in terms of PVP game mechanics, and how the cat class helps shore up the human class' weakness to griefing. I'm not even getting into the fact that the cat class has aesthetic values of its own, or how they've invested points in the vocalization tree to communicate more effectively with human players - it's an essentially worthless perk when dealing with any other class, even other cat players - or their own INT stats that sometimes let them spec into other skills - even some normally associated with the dog class. I haven't even brought up the Purr perk, which - aside from being considered soothing by many players - actually comes with a small but not insignificant regen buff.\n\nSo who really needs to explain it as a conspiracy theory involving a cat-bacteria support relationship somehow manipulating human players, when there's such obvious logic to this team dynamic? It's blatant dog class bias. Especially when the article you cite shows that it's an estimate of BETWEEN 30-50% have been exposed to T. gondii, and MAY have been infected. So that's not a guarantee of how many human players have been infected, even the percentage of exposed human players could be as much as 20% lower as you state aloud(meaning you're skewing high on purpose), and - at MAXIMUM - you've only accounted for half of all human players. It also ignores the fact that for a human player to acquire the T. gondii debuff, they have to already HAVE exposure to the cat class. Isn't it logical to assume that the support pairing may have pre-dated the application of the debuff, then? After all, how would human players be getting the debuff if they had no reason to associate with the cat class to begin with?\n\nThis also ignores the statistics that - based on the statistics of US players alone - 36% of human players team up with dogs, and 30% of human players team up with cats. So for all those scare tactic statistics, human-cat support teams are LESS numerous than human-dog support teams! But I guess the popularity of the dog class is just because they're just that amazing, right? (And, to be fair - they are. No hate to any dog mains out there; I can't argue with the facts that dogs are practically OP as a support build. I'm just tired of people sleeping on the fact that the cat class have EARNED their place in S tier, as much as the dog class has...and it always seems to be dog class stans who act like the cat class cheated its way to the top.) And, of course, this is assuming that out of the MAYBE 50% of human players there are who have the T. gondii debuff, all 100% of human-cat support teams fall within that tentative 50%. That seems pretty statistically unlikely, doesn't it?\n\nIt's pretty telling that the same player who made the video about all the positive qualities of the feline builds somehow forgot all the virtues of those builds when talking about the feline build that ~happens~ to be in direct competition with another popular support build...I'm not saying the T. gondii debuff is completely insignificant, but when that's the only aspect of the build you focus on, it stops being a 'VS' video and becomes a fluff piece for your favorite class because there's no genuine comparison being made. :/ Disappointing.
Iguana is the true support meta. It's the only service animal issued to counteract the dreaded 'crippling depression' debuff.\n\nToxoplasma and enemy detection are no good if your human party leader went and ate the business end of a shotgun while you're stuck in the house.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I started as a human how do I restart?
First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\n\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\n\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\n\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.
that yellowstone reference killed me
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
not sure if this even gets to you with almost 4k comments, just wanne say good choice of music and really good video keep it up
But what about the cats that work for humans??  IE: ship cats that control rodent populations on ships. Or cats that control rodent populations in exchange for affection? Why would cats bring owners their food? Also, cats were originally a team style build (see: lions). They live in “colonies” that support each other much like wolf packs.
Please make a video on flies
What game is that?
Please talk about the MANTIS SHRIMP! It's claws move like a .22 caliber rifle and it can boil water just by moving.
how about a video on the viable bat builds
Dog maining elitist here forgot to mention how cat's make great defensive units when you're hoarding resources, and also boost immunity to certain diseases.  They have a strong morale boosting AOE, but the strength has a greater variability than the dog class.  Overall, their stats tend to vary more.  In some cases they can even exceed that of a dog.
Have you considered talking about  deep sea animals for Halloween?
See, cats purr. Can dogs purr? No. That is why cats are better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy cat hates me. I pet her too much
The cat and dog classes are pretty good with their own reasons but nothing can beat a falcon’s air strike. Air strike takes quite some leveling up to get but once you get it, it becomes overkill. I like to pair air strike with bird eyes for increased accuracy.
Many say the sea cucumber is man's best friend.
i want to play the horseshoe crab build, can you give me the low down on its viability?
Great video about supports for human players but would you mind going into more detail on legacy patches where humans weren't the only choice in the Homo genus?

I'd love to see an analysis and guide for a primate build
How do you unlock the dog class
Please talk about the meta between rival ant teams?
Give us a dive gorilla build
I'm waiting for the sloth video, the most troll build in the game. Sloths offer great stealth and are so unattractive that very few other players even consider killing it. While the movement seems very basic there are a lot of aspects to master, today we see a lot of sloth players randomly dropping from trees and thus killing themselves. Definitely F tier but a highly interesting PvE build choice.
If it wasn't for cats, our ancestors would have all died of plague when humans began building cities. You know, because large stores of grain attract disease ridden rodents.
You say stole the top spot. I say Cats achieved the top spot. Survival of the fittest, b. Not a felines fault they managed to domesticated humans without having to learn stupid tricks. If dogs were smarter, they could have...lol. No, they couldn't.\n\nCats have always been, and will always be the supreme winners.
You think we could either get a human subclass tier list or a multipart bacterial one
Hey, um, microverse server player here (tuberculosis, yes I hated the antibiotics buff humans got), and I was wondering if the virus class is actually playable? I see them everywhere but they don't appear in the character creation menu. Are they even a playable class?
Dogs have an actual use cats just eat food and give no shits
500k or 1 mil why humans need a nerf.
What the music at 1:00 from?
I like how u ack like it is a game
i like the dont starve music
Everyone is talking about which class is better. Cat or dog? Welp, the answer is simple. If you get Positive support classes, you can have both. Not only do I reap the benefits of purr, I also get the protection of Bark.\n\nWhy choose one support style when you can have both!
What about parrot builds? I'm trying to figure out the pros and cons of all the builds and I need some help.
i wouldn't dream about EVER being forced to choose. I wouldn't tolerat it becuz its like choosing between ur children. They both thoroughly allow my heart all the magic it can hold...and MORE. Hellfire, I need some horses too, chickens maybe, throw in cpl turtles, i want a zoo. The more---the better. Life is all that better.
I would love to hear about mollusks in the meta. Specifically why gastropods like snails are so low on the tier list.
Dogs are much more work but a better support class
87 intelligence for dogs? ..... wow. I mean they are very lovable, but if you look at nature dogs really don't cut the mustard when it comes to intelligence. They are kind of not that high to be honest.
I like the don't starve soundtrack.
You forgot to mention many of cats unique abilities. Like being able to use way points and access to online maps to navigate back home no matter where a cat winds up. Or their passive ability that some spec into like ESP. Emotional sensor patrol.
Human and a whale shark build makes a overpowered aquarium,\n also do a build on alpacas.
Friendly reminder that users are stupid and will delete cat characters over the toxoplasmosis meme.\n\nPlease don't casually perpetuate it, dog mains.
I'm confused about my new build. I play a Cassowary, and I'm not sure how I should play.
Your channel is the first one I've ever supported on Patreon your content is amazing.
Can you talk about the parasite vs. commensal vs. support (mutualism) builds and which is best? Also a video about how cows are lowkey just giant exosymbiotic parasites of the bacteria living inside them would be awesome (only doing 20% of their own digestion, are you kidding me?).
The bird tier list. Make it happen.
I think an analysis of the megafauna trait would be fun and interesting
Please make a video about rat builds and their possibilities
Could you cover how humans have become more and more overpowered in recent patches?
just wondering, is there anything planned on ants?
Dog players actually have little to no control in how they want to spec, you are at the mercy of your human player.
Can we go over how the Human's two main passives, Craft and Augment, as well as its extremely high IQ stat have made it an undisputed top tier unit despite having mid to low HP, atk, def and stealth?
Nope cats are life cats help like u said but they also are the only self domesticated animal on the earth aka they CHOSE to stay with humans
Dog, if you want to care for a mammal that will love you in return for caring. Cat, if you're lonely and want a furry buddy nearby, and just want to set the food and water out.
Curious how Bear builds are doing in the meta. I’m considering maining one but I’m not sure what I want to spec
Can you give some advice on the platypus build?
The platypus is where it's at.
I was watching those videos for a month or so, and just now I understood the joke: tier means beast in German.
I would argue that in the current game meta, cats are the far superior support class. \nNot only do they grant the same initial buff that dog players do, but they also unlock the regeneration buff “Purr” \nIf you choose an inside or outside style cat player, you are also granted guarantees to a disease free guild hall caused by other low tier players such as rodents and birds. Much more effective in the most recent meta as the dog players “hunting” ability is much less needed with the current tech upgrades \nIt’s also interesting to note that while almost any cat class breed will grant the same buffs, not all dog class breeds will have the same effectiveness regarding the higher level buffs they have access to. \nCat classes also require much less player maintenance than dog classes, especially when choosing the outside cat class. \nAnother big thing to consider when looking at Support classes is the amount of time needed to reach specific buffs and the longevity of the support class chosen. While it can take years for dog classes to reach their max potential, cat classes main features are accessed within a few months. Dog classes also have an effective life span of 7-11 years of you choose the proper breed, while cats will remain good Support classes for up to 18 years or older. \n\nWhile the dog class has a lot of fancy buffs a human player can cultivate and gain access to, if you look at the time needed, the effectiveness in the current meta, the maintenance of he support class, and the life span of your companion, there really is no competition.
What purpose do hedgehogs have in their server?
Man I really wish they would turn tier zoo into a real game series.
Brb euthanising both my cats in favour of dog class.
I would like to see your tier placement of the Common Raven. Maybe along with the Elephant and Killer Whale as intelligent, social animals. I believe those three are top tier S class that inhabit Air, Land, and Sea.
What are your favorite builds?
Time to purge the cat class.
This is God damn genius!!!!!!!
Yeah, you have to train a dog for all those buffs. Doesn’t count
The music choices you used are amazing.
The runescape music in the beginning gave me nostalgia
D I S L I K E.
You should talk about the arthropod guild. the spider and insect classes have immense prevalence in the meta and ignoring them would be a mistake.
Would you ever think of splitting mobility into speed and dexterity?\nAlso, would someone care to explain the difference between defense and hp? I understand defense is kinda like armor but would there be a case of an animal with high hp and terrible defense or one with high defense and low hp?
Lmao teammates? You mean servants lol

To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
Please do a honey badger video they're such cute little deadly devils
Have you heard about the word?
Says dogs are the top of the meta\n\nGoes on to explain how cats are actually the top of the meta, while dogs are the strongest class.
I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.
WARNING⚠️\n\n\nIn the comments you will find:\n99% People writing essays about why cats are better that have also Never owned a dog \n1% this comment

I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
What about the fast that cats help keep the rodent players from griefing human storages?
I feel so cheesy playing the Human class.
You mentioned Bat builds in your previous video but haven't actually gone in depth with them, I'm thinking on starting one up but want to know what I'm getting into first
Yup, cats are the haxorz. We pown your brain. But hey if it wasn't for stray cats we would be plauged by vermin.

I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
so glad you mentioned toxoplasma. will you cover more parasite builds?
Can you talk about the mantis shrimp class
Can you do a honeybadger build video. Good atk. Great defense. And even poison resistance feats.
What the “Maned Wolf” class. Are the long legs an ability or some kind of model glitch.
I love the DS music.
You just blew my mind.
But you forgot what happened on the MacQuire Island server. Cats were banned, and rats crashed the server (along with rabbits, but rabbits don't grief nearly as hard as rats). Seabird players at least at least had a fighting chance with cat players, but cats are a hard-counter against rats. And trust me, if any player can crash a server, it is rats.\n\nGranted, the concern was the feral cat subclass as opposed to the outdoor cat playthrough, but similar effects either way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gqOzTh2pjEw?t=12m27s
A look at where Bears and its sub-classes fit in the meta would be interesting.
My dog is ok but my cat is an asshole is this some kind of game
Man I know its hard work but I really wish you uploaded more, these are awesome.
You forgot to talk about the cats' primary support ability, their purr, which only support builds and a few offensive builds can spec into at all. It's one of the few abilities that provides a heal, and it's an AoE heal at that, on top of its other benefits. It's insanely broken.

I remember the days of when the horse was way too op. The human group called mongols destroyed other human players using horse players as supports. They were way too op.
I'm really curious about the Abyssal Plane servers and their meta. I've heard there is this weird class called a Blobfish.
While the available builds are yet to be optimized, if you create a Mineralia character, robot guild is looking like it'll be pretty good as far as support classes go.\n\nIncidentally, would you mind discussing the now-removed pterosaur guild, and what it brought to the table in terms of how to get a high-weight (and potentially high-power, see also the legendary Hatzegopteryx build) build while retaining and optimizing the flight ability?
We need capybara and the slime mold
You should have a video about which overpowered builds (for their niche) should be nerfed

So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz.

This should *actually* be a real game.
I love your videos mate, keep it up !
I don’t understand why human mains even have support classes, I mean they are REALLY over powered. True human’s base and max strength is by no means the most threatening in the game but the devs gave human mains a way to high intelligence. Not only this but if humans speck even more into intelligence (especially with the “school” side quests) they can not only build homes that are practically impossible for any other players besides rat/mouse and insect mains to enter; plus the new Computer Buff they added just a little while ago human mains can practically watch the rest of us whenever they want. What I said here was barely even the tip of the ice berg, basically humans need a major debuff soon.\n- sincerely a sword fish main
I've noticed in my marine play throughs I've come across supportive microbial classes. I was just wondering at how available this class is to regular players since I've always started my upgrade tree past unicellular. I want to try and spec into algae, but I don't know where to start.
Aren't you concerned that the video might be taken down for the music?
Is the Mantis Shrimp an S tier class?
Have you heard about the word?
Says dogs are the top of the meta\n\nGoes on to explain how cats are actually the top of the meta, while dogs are the strongest class.
I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.

Talk about bears and raccoons.  Please shit on how awful pandas are
Could you do one on eusocial insects? What tier are fire ants? I'm planning on playing as a fire ant colony for my next playthrough.
I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Cats actually make pretty good support for humans. Throughout the game they've helped humans get rid of pest problems, such as mice and other rodents, who try to steal their food. And during Dark Age expansion, a lot of human players would have survived the bubonic plague if they didn't kill cats. See humans were affected by paranoia at the time and associated cats with the supernatural. They killed cats thinking it would prevent the sickness from spreading, when in actuality it did the opposite. If cats weren't hunted down at the time, they would have killed more rodents, the carriers of the plague, which would have lead to less human players getting wiped.
I need help. I started a party with both a Cat and Dog on my Human main thinking it would be new meta. But both players just cant work together which lead to me having to carry the team with no proper support. Your video made me consider ditching the Cat player but my character is already infected by the toxoplasma passive. What do I do?
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
so glad you mentioned toxoplasma. will you cover more parasite builds?
Can you talk about the mantis shrimp class
Dog playas represent.
Can you do a honeybadger build video. Good atk. Great defense. And even poison resistance feats.
What the “Maned Wolf” class. Are the long legs an ability or some kind of model glitch.
I love the DS music.
You just blew my mind.
But you forgot what happened on the MacQuire Island server. Cats were banned, and rats crashed the server (along with rabbits, but rabbits don't grief nearly as hard as rats). Seabird players at least at least had a fighting chance with cat players, but cats are a hard-counter against rats. And trust me, if any player can crash a server, it is rats.\n\nGranted, the concern was the feral cat subclass as opposed to the outdoor cat playthrough, but similar effects either way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gqOzTh2pjEw?t=12m27s
A look at where Bears and its sub-classes fit in the meta would be interesting.
My dog is ok but my cat is an asshole is this some kind of game
Man I know its hard work but I really wish you uploaded more, these are awesome.
You forgot to talk about the cats' primary support ability, their purr, which only support builds and a few offensive builds can spec into at all. It's one of the few abilities that provides a heal, and it's an AoE heal at that, on top of its other benefits. It's insanely broken.
Fable the lost chapters music?
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
What about the fast that cats help keep the rodent players from griefing human storages?
I feel so cheesy playing the Human class.
You mentioned Bat builds in your previous video but haven't actually gone in depth with them, I'm thinking on starting one up but want to know what I'm getting into first
Yup, cats are the haxorz. We pown your brain. But hey if it wasn't for stray cats we would be plauged by vermin.
that yellowstone reference killed me
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
>Cat owners are infected with a mind virus\n>This is why my dog that eats its own shit, I have to walk every day and  barks at passing cars  at 4 am is superior

talk about the ocean sunfish build
Don't forget about cats' purr, which accelerates healing of themselves and those very near them
I'm not too much of the creative type but I would love to see a video done about chimps monkeys and other primates
Can you talk about the highest and lowest tier characters?
Ugh, that toxoplasmosis nonsense is ridiculously overplayed. And talk about bias, what about cats not being banned on Middle Eastern servers?
The Khajiit has wares if you have the coin
Great video, dude. I was curious about the best common support class for human players. I've seen some go with less-than-common supports that really don't seem like they actually fit as supports, but allow the human plays to absolutely excel in certain servers, primarily when they're under-equipped. You ever seen a human with the street vendor prestige with a panther or jaguar playing support? There's a very popular video showcasing one of these players with a fucking lion support in south africa. Try to gank that guy, I'd dare you!\n\nOne thing that's really strange to me is why anyone would actively play mosquito. They've got to be the lowest tier out of all the insect players, somewhere lower than E tier. Their natural predators don't even require them for their own playthroughs! The devs could totally wipe all mosquito players from the game, banning them permenantly, and the only class that would even notice would be the human players. That's a level beyond low tier if I've ever seen it. Even housefly players aren't that useless. What does a mosquito main even do all day? They have some of the shortest playthroughs I can even think of and are less effective at making an actual change in the meta than something like yersinia pestis players, who you'll remember damn near banned humans from the european continent earlier this season (of course that was with great help from rat players and there's a huge debate on whether or not it would've even been possible without the rat flea mains) \n\nAnyway I look forward to more of your analysis of the current meta. You're clearly quite familiar with a lot of the mechanics of the game.
There are couple builds that are suporisingly vital for the current meta:\nBees keep 85% of all servers flowers going,\nBats keep pest-insect -players at bay by harassing 99% of their builds &\nWhale-players' excerement keep certain CO2-eating -alagaes alive, thus indirectly keeping the new Climate Change-event at bay (well at least slows it). (Information from science-magazine Tieteen Kuvalehti) Then there are also vulture-players, that by devouring carcasses prevent some diseases from spreading to thr rest of the server.\n\nI'd be happy to hear about these true MVP-builds!\n\nThanks for stupid/smart/original content!
Do the human build,It’s what I main and I’m kind of just sitting in a Jai-I mean school,and Ist really boring.
The next patch, Tremors of Yellowstone looks to be a blast.
Dang RuneScape soundtrack in the beginning brings back so much memories
I kinda wish some company would actually make a game where you can actually play on the entire earth as different species like the stuff you do on your channel
Why are bees S tier?
if you want to choose a really good dog build, I suggest the Black Russian Terrier, they will work much more like a bear, they were trained initially to chase escaping prisoners from Gulags, they will present the strength and the likeliness of a bear, and still keep all  the strengths of a dog.
Do an insect tier list.
Cats are junglers or a damage support, while dogs are heavily reliant on their human carry to progress, while when multiple cat plahers have a lazy human player they can still strive and also cats scaling in the African servers are broken and dominate the meta
Ok so dogs _can_ be useful with specialty skill sets (even though they're usually only companions) however it's important to realize the overall cost to the human player. A dog is like having a perpetual child who is very needy, drawn toward self-destructive behaviors, and makes messes readily (often unintentionally griefing their own human companions.) Cats, however, are like college students. They aren't completely independent but if you make the correct resources available, they can usually make due on their own very well. They also cause little accidental griefing comparatively and do not have the aggression buffs of most dogs so they can more easily live side by side with other players in a human-led party who they might normally consider prey (like birds and fish.)
Bat class tier \nFor mammal players that want bird perks
what about the alleged healing properties of a cat's purr? That's a pretty useful support ability.
I love your videos. I have some questions:\nIs friendly fire cannibalism?\nIn Tier zoo, if it is possible, what are Prestige class? (class you can only unlock by upping a basic class like becoming palladin after warrior).
I love these videos so much!!! Thanks for making these!!
Its funny because Tier means animal in german.
I main oxpecker and my hippo is the best tank and support so kys I don't agree so I have the rights to destroy your self esteem. Also, can u do a video just talking about the Tier because sometimes I get confused
Lol the DST soundtrack made me think I had left the game on.
Do a Pangolin Build video
Can you explain why chickens are in D while pigs are in B? More people eat chicken across the world and chickens also provide eggs while pigs only provide their meat. Chickens also grow faster and are easier to take care of. Also, why are horses in B?
Can you talk about the viability of nudibranchs and other high-aesthetic builds?
I think it would be cool to see where ant colonies fit on this... would we play as an individual or the entire colony... same with bee and termite colonies
You can play almost any class as human-support.  I just came back from the snakes video, thinking what about pets?  I main Ball Python, my character is the most boopable snek in the world!~
I remember the days of when the horse was way too op. The human group called mongols destroyed other human players using horse players as supports. They were way too op.
Hey,can you make a insects guide,the bee and mosquito/wasp are like the pistol srimph,all DPS but are kinda of a support too!look at the bee,it has a stinger and armor,looks like a great bruiser build,dosnt it??well,human player farm them for the honey consumable and the wax crafting material,and are one of the few classes that SINERGISES with plant kindom players,and look  at the mosquito,similar,and supports a DPS class:the Malaria build,giving them a GIGANTIC spd boost and the the ability to go though skin buff,giving the GIGANTIC DoT on human players is so fun!make a guide on them,NOW!!
What you say about Cats is true, but imprecise. Remember back in the Bronze Age days when Mice and other species griefed Humans' crops? Before Human players realised they were the absolute top-tier class? I remember when Cats in most Egypt servers were extremely popular, employed to hunt vermin and protect the crops, so much so that it became a meme religion akin to twitch's Helix Fossil; then again, a good 90% of Egypt servers' religion was based on class memes, and you could even argue that it was born out of Toxoplasma Gondiis' trolling.\n\nAfter BA was over, Cat memes got old and were particularly hated in Europe servers during Medieval Age. Black Cats were particularly hated, and most of the time their Human supportees were unreasonably hunted down simply for collaborating even once. I mean, I know those memes were bad, I still remember them, but why kill other Human players over them, even the newbies?\n\nThen that became a meme and luckly unfunny class memes came to a stop, for a while at least.\n\nNowadays Cat supports aren't used anymore in crop farming (AKA farm farming) because we have better Farmer weapons and skills for Humans in 1stWC servers along with P2W consumables to protect the crops, but if it wasn't for TPG existing and Cats lacking CC, they would be the absolute top-tier support/hunter hybrid class.\n\nI'm a Chow Chow support Dog main btw. Sorry if this comment sounded biased.
You're growing so fast, when you grow even more hopefully some game company will help you actually make the game. Would be awesome
I'm really curious about the Abyssal Plane servers and their meta. I've heard there is this weird class called a Blobfish.
While the available builds are yet to be optimized, if you create a Mineralia character, robot guild is looking like it'll be pretty good as far as support classes go.\n\nIncidentally, would you mind discussing the now-removed pterosaur guild, and what it brought to the table in terms of how to get a high-weight (and potentially high-power, see also the legendary Hatzegopteryx build) build while retaining and optimizing the flight ability?
We need capybara and the slime mold
You should have a video about which overpowered builds (for their niche) should be nerfed
Watching this as a have 1 cat laying on my legs and another sleeping around my neck/head, I feel like I might be a tad biased.
How about looking at the past meta at oceanic preds. How they rised & fell and if there might be hold outs still refusing to quit.\n\nAlso might be interesting if the devs might bring back some of these builds since there have been possible leaks of some subclasses returning to the current meta.
Explain the immortal jelly and how it has been breaking the meta for as long as it existed!

I'm interested in your opinion of the viability of the blue ringed octopus build
What about the cervidae builds?
So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.\n\nDo you think this ability has any real use or effect in the current meta ?\n\nJan 27, 2003\nWhy do cats purr? - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/

We are living in a simulation. Someone above us already invested this.

lmao, 80,000 views and its 2nd on trending.Conservative videos reach billions in a day or so, only an hour on trending before its taken down. YouTube's Algorithm my ass
So electronic Velcro? What's with the random lights on the strap?
For 200 dollars more you can a legit VR headset... I mean I guess this is cool if all you want to do is watch some movies and sheeit or if you dont have a decent PC. The more people who experience VR the better widen the consumer base.
This doesn't tell me shit and why was it so loud
In 5 years this is going to be the equivalent of the big grey phone when cell phones first came out
Nope. Waiting for generation 10 at least.
Im so confused, what do it do? what are the features? a video about nothing...

Some fucking dumbasses will crash their car while wearing this
Ah I just cracked my phone and than they make this why why
VR that’s no longer tethered to a PC will change the game, especially at the cheaper price. Wish the video released some specs though.
i feel that this device is just good enough for streaming video
Introduce the Camera you're using
How long until another company remakes this but changes it slightly and claims it as their own? Also without giving credit to oculus
Yay another shitty product so I can beat off in 3 dimensions
GOTTA OCULUS GO TO THE STORE NOW
That's pretty ok 👌
So.. I guess this is for those who absolutely cannot afford a smart phone or a decent PC? How would they spend $199 for VR? If this is an embedded hardware, it also means it is not expandable and will become obsolete faster than any other VR headsets.
Thx this is a must buy

Never thought I’d see the day that VR would be as cheap as 200 bucks.
More like Oculus No\nAMIRITE HEHEHHEIEUEHIEHEH\nJk
Cant wait, damn the negative replys...
Why is this on trending
So dank will buy again 18283828181/181822288282
So... Google Cardboard: Definitive Edition?
Don't know why some people complaining about Oculus Go.. This is GearVR level headset in just $200. You don't need to pay $800++ anymore. \nYes, it has no positional tracking, but this is only $200! Santa Cruz prototype will cost a lot more, you will see. \nP.s. I personaly will buy this just to watch movies in virtual cinema. For me it's dream come true..
For $200 I'm in.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
No one cares about vr anymore other than fat losers who want it for a virtual girlfriend
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
The VIVE is still better though o3o
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class
ELECTRONEUM... THE NEXT BITCOIN!?\n\nIt's worth buying at least $100 and see what happens. Many people wish they knew about Bitcoin before it took off! \n\nBitcoin started at $0.003 and is now over $5,000 each coin!\nThis new coin is in Pre-market Sale right now through October first. Offering an extra 10% bonus coins with each purchase! Coin sale is at $0.01 per Coin. Goes public on November 1st 2017. \n\nUse my link, when you buy, to get another 1% free coins:\n\nhttps://my.electroneum.com/join/43E7AC\n\nHit me up if you need help getting setup.\nTake advantage of this before you wish you had!
Now fix your customer service department. It's rubbish
So, nobody’s gotten the memo that VR is a stupid gimmick? SadX
Can you watch porn on it, asking for a friend.
This thing better have a gtx 1080

I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
VR is a disaster
What generation of iPhone is this?
Why do you need one of these when you can literally made this shit yourself with only cardboard and less than $10
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s
This came out the same day I got my oculus rift
More like Oculus stop\n amirite guys \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a life
Why does the FCC have a say, when will they say, when will you sell. This advert is less than ideal.
By stand-alone I’m guessing it won’t need a PC or smartphone?
This nigga still want a season 2 of Re:Zero?

ok i really wanna buy the oculus rift but an someone explay this to me:\n1. i would like to walk in vr (just move a bit you know) is this possible with 1 camera? or 2?\n2. i saw that its possible to play htc vive games with the rift?? is that true and could someone (short) explain how?\nthank you!
WOAH WOAH WOAH SLOW DOWN! Your telling me.. That Oculus Rift is going PORTABLE?! I MEAN I KNOW YOU MADE THE GEAR VR BUT THIS?! THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CENTURY WE'RE STEPPING INTO PEOPLE!
Yes keep going! Sword art online in real life here I come!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I knew it was a trap I'd still put it
GO? Go where? You're completely blind folded.
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
I'll buy one when it plugs into my brain
Wow look a waste of money!!!
Will gangbang porn be better with these?
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
In portuguese Glass means Óculus. Oculos, get it?!
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
no more looking at your kids stupid faces in the car rides home
So will this be used for phones or what?
I don't get the on the go part?
Does it connect to steam?
and how to connect, wifi ?
Your move Vive. Let's have a full blown VR war that's actually affordable.
Ppl will think they can drive with them on
Vr is dead. Stop already
So when does full-dive virtual reality release?
Fuck facebook, I will not give them a cent of my money. Garbage of a company.
If it is possible to connect it to my pc to it then I'm buying it
Cell phones are among the foulest items that are on this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they grow like fungus where it is decay, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a cell phone and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the cell phone will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.\n\n Arguably the scariest magical (technological) item of the your universe, a  cell phone feeds upon human happiness and leaves its victim in a state of depression and despair. The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth
Wait these guys aren't dead?
So basically Rick and Mortys vr thing

As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
At least Facebook is still trying.
$200?! I'm actually excited to get this
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
Wow I want one now and that price is perfect.
For $200 I'm in.

will this work in steam vr?
I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.

So it's essentially the gear vr minus the phone. It's literally exactly the same. Even the controller. And that one is made by occulus lmao
VR is a disaster
OCULUS SUCKS, VIVE IS BETTER
By stand-alone I’m guessing it won’t need a PC or smartphone?
I hope virtual reality never becomes a thing.
So....they finally made their own Google Cardboard? Seems there a bit late to their own party, Jesus.
So will this be used for phones or what?
So no pc connection? What makes this better than my phone thrown in one of those google cardboard boxes for like 5 bucks max? I'm only here for the mobile VR porn anyways.
But it does have its own prossesor inside or it connect with the computer
$1000?
fuck facebook
will this work in steam vr?
Will Oculus Go support Home and Dash?
I dont have an expensive cell phone and with gyroscope so i probably will get one Oculus Go to watch movies, videos 360 wherever i want confortably. I dont care about VR games either.
As long as this is a step above phone VR, I’m game. I don’t expect bleeding edge graphics from a more expensive VR headset, but non potato quality would be nice.
Hopefully this evolves into a virtual reality game where we end up getting trapped by the creator and if we die in the game we die in the real world.
At least Facebook is still trying.
Maybe Oculus could partner with Nintendo to make Switch VR, the joycons could be the hands, just connect 1 to the switch (for the gyroscopic features and use the other as a controller, or have 1 one the switch and use 2 for full motion in both hands... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThough that would kinda just kill this product... eh, I’d buy Switch VR, or if they called it Virtual Boy 2.0 :D)))—/—
So like can I play Xbox?
Oculus Go to the polls
Ummm...didn't really show me any thing there bud.
I wait for the day when they can make sword art online a real thing
nice! now i can use it on my drive to work and in class

I got dee oculus and what's the difference?
Let's see: 139 for Samsung gear VR with controller, or 200 dollars for Oculus Go? I think you know where your money should land at...
As a PSVR owner, and a hater of Facebook...I support this. The more people buy any VR system the more it will grow
This doesn't show us much about the product
This doesn't answer any of my questions. Where do i go to get answers?
Oculus is like the Apple of VR, while HTC is the Windows.
Is it the same to the other oculus beside not having wires but does it require anything? And why not out for Christmas?
oculus go to the polls
More like Oculus stop\n amirite guys \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a life
Why does the FCC have a say, when will they say, when will you sell. This advert is less than ideal.

For $200 I'm in.
What generation of iPhone is this?
i really hope you don't need to insert a phone...
I got mines for 8 dollars at dd’s
This came out the same day I got my oculus rift
for 200 this seems like the first true consumer VR for the masses seems to have enough tech jammed in there to be well worth the price
Will buy...if it's 75hz refresh and has zero god rays! Not holding my breath on either of those!
That’s fresh
I need it!
Oculus Go *WASTE YOUR MONEY*

I've heard it has a LCD display, which is a strange decision because the Rift moved to OLED due to LCD having problems with persistence?
fuck facebook
The second I read this title in my notification, I started to giggle.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I respectfully disagree with people about a cats  independence/pride not having value in a support class. Yes dogs builds can do many things for humans that cats builds will never be able to do but how much is that needed by the average human overall? Dogs unfortunately need a huge amount of  maintenance daily and otherwise.\n1 food\n2 grooming, \n3 walks\n4 training\n5  space\n6 healthcare\n7 entertainment  \n8 affection \n9 time \nall this can be quit daunting to a human who just needs a moral boost and/ or some cuddling but  not so much time to support a support class. this make the cat a great choice for many stressed overworked people.\ncats do need daily maintenance but compared to the dog there is no contest.\n\n1 food independence bonus!If outdoors cat build may find food and feed themselves \n2 grooming independence bonus self grooming! *not all build types apply recommend scratch post for nail care to nullify the home degrade from cat scratch.  \n3 walks  independence bonus self walking human not needed\n4 training independence penalty! you want me do what? f that I ain't your slave. independence bonus No potty training needed! If i hide my waste in this sandbox no one will ever  know  \n5 space 'independence bonus! yard not needed\n6 healthcare needs same support \n7entertaninmet needs same support\n8 affection needs same support\n9 time independence bonus flexible time needs! time reduction up to 50% or more!
Cats vs Dogs? You mean BB gun vs M16?
if toxiplasmosis is as strong as you say, why is it that you give all of the credit to the dog class and none to the cat class?\n\nI wonder if dogs have a hidden status effect that caused the imbalance in this video :thinking:
How would one go about a meerkat build?
You are a dog person eh?  Cats help with mice and vermin by removing them from the area (saving food stores), and provide a healing buff with a purr move.... this creates a regen that affects the cat and any creature in contact with it.  I hope you see this because the purr move is the only reason why I spec'd my noobs as cat builds.  Dog builds do not have any regen abilities... and they require more effort out of players that spec'd as human.
Can we get an arachnid video?
Can you do a video on the Kangaroo class? I feel like it’s a good class but I just don’t know how to use it well.
.. I love this so much....how did I never know these existed? And I'm sporting Cat x3 + Dog x1 +... wait do pet turkey's count? They're wild but I feed them occasionally...
Every person that wants him to be biased to cats: HE'S BIASED TOWARDS DOGS, CATS HAVE SAVED HUMANS FROM INTRUDERS IN 2 CASES IN HISTORY AND COMAS!!!!!I!I!III!!II
Does that make the cat a parasite?
How should I go about building my bacteria class?
Can you do a tier list on the ants. The one species that is everywhere you go no matter what
Since Halloween is coming up could you talk about the controversial Ghost builds?
Could you talk about the bear class?
I think this video is a tad bias,  but it's ok. Adblock😎
so... cats are too good at other things to be the true best support class.
I thought this was for real life, then I thought he was talking about a video game, then then I thought he was talking about real life in a video game... I’m so confuzzled
Why was the snake not listed in the human support tier list?  Are you saying snakes aren't real pets?  But IDC, it's still a great video!
Im glad such a unique underated channel is getting some spotlight and is tending.
Id like to know more about the leaf cutter or ant meta in general
A video about owl would help out my dumbass brother who only plays crazy offensive builds

I'm a goat build, trying to go for that mountain goat doe, need to level up my legs and my hooves i think, can you help me? i don't really know.
When everyone gets salty because the cats aren't the strongest support class.
What the fuck is going on in this video?
What about the tier list for the North American server?
You need to remember pure support classes. Cats and dogs can both play independent of humans but what about classes that support the microbiome? Humans can survive without cats dogs and other macro-scale classes but micro-scale classes are inherently necessary to their continued dominance. Of course this also affects most other players in the entire game from micro to macro so if you're analyzing around the human perspective then perhaps it's not necessary to highlight, but it's important to remember that these classes form the backbone of any and all macro-scale strategies.
True pro humans have both cats and dogs as supports. Lots of maintenance, but the payoff is ridiculous.
Do a video on the Axolotl
I still like cats
Man, the salt from catfuckers is glorious. Can't even handle shitposting if it mentions the catshit from which toxo plasmosis is spread.
Talk to me when you make a dragon guide, smh to many plebs maxing fire breathe everyone knows you max wings then scales then fire
Great content! Support classes are among my favorites.\n\nCould you explore the current rodent meta?  There are a lot of interesting and diverse specialized builds, considering they almost uniformly revolve around the (probably OP) constantly growing incisors.  \n\nAlso, how are capybara players able to spec into such a unique ability as serenity aura?  They can befriend other players with startling ease.  Is there some wololo ayoyoyo at work, or is this just playstyle?  Inquiring minds want to know.
Hey, a friend of mine swears by the tarantula specs, but I'm not sure I'm sold on the arachnid guild or if I can get past how creepy it would look. Is a arachnid build really viable?
Now let's talk about the worst class\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman,i mean we smart but not smart enough to figure out that we should stop killing each other damn griefers(also human builds have a load of debuffs)
You should do one based on some of the stranger characters like say duck-billed platypus,  Narwals, Sea Pigs,  anything else thats just kinda bizarre
love the use of the dont starve sound track
Talk about the best survival builds
First time here and its great
So glad that your videos made it to trending so that other people can see your beautiful work, keep it going man 👍
The price hike for Daraprim was for insurance companies. People can get it for really cheap.
I'd like to see you cover the banning of the Dodo Bird, it's something I don't know much about and would love to hear your take on it.
What about ranged classes? \n\n\nEtc spitting cobras spray venom to their opponent causing victims health to keep draining until death unless the opponent is too big which is usually not the case because in the desert servers (which is where they live) the opponents are usually small enough for death usually that's their main attack but if that doesn't work they aren't afraid to bite you with the same effects \n\n\n\nElement venom \nIntelligence: 40\nStealth: 70\nDefence-low (but high for its size) so: 20\nSpeed- once again low (but high for its size): 30\nHP:20\n\nAnother ranged class is the Egyptian vulture.\nEgyptian vultures pick up rocks into the air using the move flight which utilizes the air element to lift it up in the air.After the vultures pick up the stones in the air they drop the stones on eggs (an earth element move) with tough shells killing their opponents before the baby stage reducing competition but the vultures had to develop high intelligence for that sometimes they just pick up the stone and start hammering at the egg without even flying into the air.\n\nSpeed:80\nStealth:80\nAttack:30\nDefence:25\nIntelligence:80\nHP:30
Can you mention Axolotl mains and give them a few pointers? I'm not one, but I was considering wiping my previous account as a fox to try something with better health retention.
Everyone’s joking about having real classes while I’m still sitting here scarred by the dogs and cats friggin murdering anything they see
This video is on trending! Well deserved, it will get more subs! I subbed when the channel had ~15k subs. 👌
What tier is best for jungle?
Cats are the embodiement of PvP players. Selfish as hell and cheat wherever they can. Dogs form thier APvP guild to contain the cats, then get baged by dog catchers. Wow games really do model real life sometimes.
I've been looking forward to your analysis of dogs since your first video
Talk about the platypus (also I think you could revisit this topic)
You should look into the balancing of different reproductive systems. Seems completely unbalanced that some classes have to camp their own spawn point to defend against griefers for months just because they have the egg skill tree when others get the incredibly easy budding ability.
Hey so are you ever gonna cover how massively unbalanced the Human players are? When are they gonna get nerfed? They are basically playing their own game at this point.
Will you make a video discussing the importance of the defensive meta and name some specific animals that follow this build?
So dogs are good for combo attacks and cats are the healers so cats are mercy(I think that's the healers name I don't know lol)and dogs are bastion,mcree and sometimes genji
This is why I don't raid with cats, Their toxoplasma parasite infects the group as well as the main boss which leads to unfair distribution of DKP. Always in their favor :(
Blue collar humans and White collar humans
What if the devs make a Mars expansion pack? Which tiers will do well on that map?
Since you did big cats can you do canines too? I know hyenas are more related to cats but could you add em in too if you do? Thanks LOVE YOUR VIDS
Mitochondria are the best support class. Nobody in there right mind would play without one on there team.
For the dog you forgot about recognizing invisible desieses and alerting their handler
I think it's time for a video on the number 1 undisputed SSS tier human, perhaps a  light recap of guild conflicts would be interesting (tier history series when??)
#17 Trending. Congrats for making it, and definitely lookong forawrd to what's next.
Dogs: Look at this team! We're gonna do great!\n\nCats; I need healing!
Cats have some of the best escape in the game in their climbing ability and acrobatic movement.\nBeing unable to reach the same levels of pure physical power doesn't matter because a cat can simply escape whenever its in a bad matchup, unlike a dog.
When you realize you're #20 on trending, wow great moves keep it up proud of you
i don't believe in the conspiracy, it might play a small part  but its probably cats because tribes helped them cause the kill mice that eat grain, so they were a support class but not any more.
Can you explain what the hell is going on with the great Potoo?

I have a problem. I initially thought being a fish player was a good idea, but ultimately decided to make a switch. I want to make a switch to Megatherium, but my game always seems to crash when I try. I was wondering if you could make a video going over how to build with Sloths, or even how to build with the Megatherium (if my game stops crashing when I try to make one.) It would be incredibly helpful.
It's so obvious when someone is a dog main. :/\n\nCooking up conspiracy theories for why cats are such a high-ranked support class when even back in pre-release, cats remain THE most effective check for griefing mouse, rat, bird, mole, and even some lizard builds. Human players aren't really specced to handle those classes, never have been. For one thing, the larger build size of humans making it easy for smaller builds like the rodent class to easily evade them by retreating to terrain where bigger builds can't follow, allowing them to actually establish spawn points within a human player's territory and also sneak into human bases and steal valuable drops and resources directly from their storage containers. Plus, humans just dumped way too many stats into INT and its skill trees, and failed to go deep enough into the Perception skill tree to pick up on the heightened hearing, sense of smell, or even night vision perks that would help negate the lower tier classes' ability to grief them. Yeah, humans may dominate the current meta in terms of their influence on the meta itself, but the fact is that there will always be a thousand low-level players for every high-level one - and if the low-level players can grief the high-level players through sheer numbers, without being checked, that gradual erosion on the high tier player is going to start showing more and more of an effect.\n\nEnter, my friends, the cat class.\n\nThe cat class, as you noted, never made the switch from their assassin role to a support role. Why, then, are they considered a S tier support class? It's simple - the cat class never made the switch to a support role because it didn't need to. Its abilities as a stealth assassin class are exactly what human players needed, and so human players started pairing with cat players exactly as they were. The cat class comes STANDARD with all the abilities required to handle the numerous low-tier griefers that human players simply aren't equipped to, and any cat player playing solo will already BE tackling those griefers because it's the most logical, natural playstyle for anyone who specs into the class to begin with. What else are you going to do with all those stealth and attack points, especially at that build size? And then a human player comes along, sees what your class can do(that theirs can't, but desperately needs), and offers you a mutually beneficial arrangement where it shares its resources with you, in exchange for your doing exactly what you were already doing - just in their territory. Like I said, you can look back through past versions of the game all the way back to pre-1.0 and see this logic at work, with cat and human players teaming up as early as the Ancient Egyptian expansion.\n\nAnd all this is talking purely in terms of PVP game mechanics, and how the cat class helps shore up the human class' weakness to griefing. I'm not even getting into the fact that the cat class has aesthetic values of its own, or how they've invested points in the vocalization tree to communicate more effectively with human players - it's an essentially worthless perk when dealing with any other class, even other cat players - or their own INT stats that sometimes let them spec into other skills - even some normally associated with the dog class. I haven't even brought up the Purr perk, which - aside from being considered soothing by many players - actually comes with a small but not insignificant regen buff.\n\nSo who really needs to explain it as a conspiracy theory involving a cat-bacteria support relationship somehow manipulating human players, when there's such obvious logic to this team dynamic? It's blatant dog class bias. Especially when the article you cite shows that it's an estimate of BETWEEN 30-50% have been exposed to T. gondii, and MAY have been infected. So that's not a guarantee of how many human players have been infected, even the percentage of exposed human players could be as much as 20% lower as you state aloud(meaning you're skewing high on purpose), and - at MAXIMUM - you've only accounted for half of all human players. It also ignores the fact that for a human player to acquire the T. gondii debuff, they have to already HAVE exposure to the cat class. Isn't it logical to assume that the support pairing may have pre-dated the application of the debuff, then? After all, how would human players be getting the debuff if they had no reason to associate with the cat class to begin with?\n\nThis also ignores the statistics that - based on the statistics of US players alone - 36% of human players team up with dogs, and 30% of human players team up with cats. So for all those scare tactic statistics, human-cat support teams are LESS numerous than human-dog support teams! But I guess the popularity of the dog class is just because they're just that amazing, right? (And, to be fair - they are. No hate to any dog mains out there; I can't argue with the facts that dogs are practically OP as a support build. I'm just tired of people sleeping on the fact that the cat class have EARNED their place in S tier, as much as the dog class has...and it always seems to be dog class stans who act like the cat class cheated its way to the top.) And, of course, this is assuming that out of the MAYBE 50% of human players there are who have the T. gondii debuff, all 100% of human-cat support teams fall within that tentative 50%. That seems pretty statistically unlikely, doesn't it?\n\nIt's pretty telling that the same player who made the video about all the positive qualities of the feline builds somehow forgot all the virtues of those builds when talking about the feline build that ~happens~ to be in direct competition with another popular support build...I'm not saying the T. gondii debuff is completely insignificant, but when that's the only aspect of the build you focus on, it stops being a 'VS' video and becomes a fluff piece for your favorite class because there's no genuine comparison being made. :/ Disappointing.
Iguana is the true support meta. It's the only service animal issued to counteract the dreaded 'crippling depression' debuff.\n\nToxoplasma and enemy detection are no good if your human party leader went and ate the business end of a shotgun while you're stuck in the house.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I started as a human how do I restart?
First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\n\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\n\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\n\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.
that yellowstone reference killed me
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
not sure if this even gets to you with almost 4k comments, just wanne say good choice of music and really good video keep it up
But what about the cats that work for humans??  IE: ship cats that control rodent populations on ships. Or cats that control rodent populations in exchange for affection? Why would cats bring owners their food? Also, cats were originally a team style build (see: lions). They live in “colonies” that support each other much like wolf packs.
Please make a video on flies
What game is that?
Please talk about the MANTIS SHRIMP! It's claws move like a .22 caliber rifle and it can boil water just by moving.
how about a video on the viable bat builds
Dog maining elitist here forgot to mention how cat's make great defensive units when you're hoarding resources, and also boost immunity to certain diseases.  They have a strong morale boosting AOE, but the strength has a greater variability than the dog class.  Overall, their stats tend to vary more.  In some cases they can even exceed that of a dog.
Have you considered talking about  deep sea animals for Halloween?
See, cats purr. Can dogs purr? No. That is why cats are better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy cat hates me. I pet her too much
The cat and dog classes are pretty good with their own reasons but nothing can beat a falcon’s air strike. Air strike takes quite some leveling up to get but once you get it, it becomes overkill. I like to pair air strike with bird eyes for increased accuracy.
Many say the sea cucumber is man's best friend.
i want to play the horseshoe crab build, can you give me the low down on its viability?
Great video about supports for human players but would you mind going into more detail on legacy patches where humans weren't the only choice in the Homo genus?

I'd love to see an analysis and guide for a primate build

Please talk about the meta between rival ant teams?
Give us a dive gorilla build
I'm waiting for the sloth video, the most troll build in the game. Sloths offer great stealth and are so unattractive that very few other players even consider killing it. While the movement seems very basic there are a lot of aspects to master, today we see a lot of sloth players randomly dropping from trees and thus killing themselves. Definitely F tier but a highly interesting PvE build choice.
If it wasn't for cats, our ancestors would have all died of plague when humans began building cities. You know, because large stores of grain attract disease ridden rodents.
You say stole the top spot. I say Cats achieved the top spot. Survival of the fittest, b. Not a felines fault they managed to domesticated humans without having to learn stupid tricks. If dogs were smarter, they could have...lol. No, they couldn't.\n\nCats have always been, and will always be the supreme winners.
You think we could either get a human subclass tier list or a multipart bacterial one
Hey, um, microverse server player here (tuberculosis, yes I hated the antibiotics buff humans got), and I was wondering if the virus class is actually playable? I see them everywhere but they don't appear in the character creation menu. Are they even a playable class?
Dogs have an actual use cats just eat food and give no shits
500k or 1 mil why humans need a nerf.
What the music at 1:00 from?
I like how u ack like it is a game
i like the dont starve music
Everyone is talking about which class is better. Cat or dog? Welp, the answer is simple. If you get Positive support classes, you can have both. Not only do I reap the benefits of purr, I also get the protection of Bark.\n\nWhy choose one support style when you can have both!
What about parrot builds? I'm trying to figure out the pros and cons of all the builds and I need some help.
i wouldn't dream about EVER being forced to choose. I wouldn't tolerat it becuz its like choosing between ur children. They both thoroughly allow my heart all the magic it can hold...and MORE. Hellfire, I need some horses too, chickens maybe, throw in cpl turtles, i want a zoo. The more---the better. Life is all that better.
I would love to hear about mollusks in the meta. Specifically why gastropods like snails are so low on the tier list.
Dogs are much more work but a better support class
87 intelligence for dogs? ..... wow. I mean they are very lovable, but if you look at nature dogs really don't cut the mustard when it comes to intelligence. They are kind of not that high to be honest.
I like the don't starve soundtrack.
You forgot to mention many of cats unique abilities. Like being able to use way points and access to online maps to navigate back home no matter where a cat winds up. Or their passive ability that some spec into like ESP. Emotional sensor patrol.
Human and a whale shark build makes a overpowered aquarium,\n also do a build on alpacas.
Friendly reminder that users are stupid and will delete cat characters over the toxoplasmosis meme.\n\nPlease don't casually perpetuate it, dog mains.
I'm confused about my new build. I play a Cassowary, and I'm not sure how I should play.
Your channel is the first one I've ever supported on Patreon your content is amazing.
Can you talk about the parasite vs. commensal vs. support (mutualism) builds and which is best? Also a video about how cows are lowkey just giant exosymbiotic parasites of the bacteria living inside them would be awesome (only doing 20% of their own digestion, are you kidding me?).
The bird tier list. Make it happen.
I think an analysis of the megafauna trait would be fun and interesting
Please make a video about rat builds and their possibilities
Could you cover how humans have become more and more overpowered in recent patches?
just wondering, is there anything planned on ants?
Dog players actually have little to no control in how they want to spec, you are at the mercy of your human player.
Can we go over how the Human's two main passives, Craft and Augment, as well as its extremely high IQ stat have made it an undisputed top tier unit despite having mid to low HP, atk, def and stealth?
Nope cats are life cats help like u said but they also are the only self domesticated animal on the earth aka they CHOSE to stay with humans
Dog, if you want to care for a mammal that will love you in return for caring. Cat, if you're lonely and want a furry buddy nearby, and just want to set the food and water out.
Curious how Bear builds are doing in the meta. I’m considering maining one but I’m not sure what I want to spec
Can you give some advice on the platypus build?
The platypus is where it's at.
I was watching those videos for a month or so, and just now I understood the joke: tier means beast in German.
I would argue that in the current game meta, cats are the far superior support class. \nNot only do they grant the same initial buff that dog players do, but they also unlock the regeneration buff “Purr” \nIf you choose an inside or outside style cat player, you are also granted guarantees to a disease free guild hall caused by other low tier players such as rodents and birds. Much more effective in the most recent meta as the dog players “hunting” ability is much less needed with the current tech upgrades \nIt’s also interesting to note that while almost any cat class breed will grant the same buffs, not all dog class breeds will have the same effectiveness regarding the higher level buffs they have access to. \nCat classes also require much less player maintenance than dog classes, especially when choosing the outside cat class. \nAnother big thing to consider when looking at Support classes is the amount of time needed to reach specific buffs and the longevity of the support class chosen. While it can take years for dog classes to reach their max potential, cat classes main features are accessed within a few months. Dog classes also have an effective life span of 7-11 years of you choose the proper breed, while cats will remain good Support classes for up to 18 years or older. \n\nWhile the dog class has a lot of fancy buffs a human player can cultivate and gain access to, if you look at the time needed, the effectiveness in the current meta, the maintenance of he support class, and the life span of your companion, there really is no competition.
What purpose do hedgehogs have in their server?
Man I really wish they would turn tier zoo into a real game series.
Brb euthanising both my cats in favour of dog class.
I would like to see your tier placement of the Common Raven. Maybe along with the Elephant and Killer Whale as intelligent, social animals. I believe those three are top tier S class that inhabit Air, Land, and Sea.
What are your favorite builds?
Time to purge the cat class.
This is God damn genius!!!!!!!
Yeah, you have to train a dog for all those buffs. Doesn’t count
The music choices you used are amazing.
The runescape music in the beginning gave me nostalgia
D I S L I K E.
You should talk about the arthropod guild. the spider and insect classes have immense prevalence in the meta and ignoring them would be a mistake.
Would you ever think of splitting mobility into speed and dexterity?\nAlso, would someone care to explain the difference between defense and hp? I understand defense is kinda like armor but would there be a case of an animal with high hp and terrible defense or one with high defense and low hp?
Lmao teammates? You mean servants lol
Kodiak grizzly? Best 1v1?

talk about the ocean sunfish build
First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\n\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\n\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\n\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.
To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
Please do a honey badger video they're such cute little deadly devils
Have you heard about the word?
Says dogs are the top of the meta\n\nGoes on to explain how cats are actually the top of the meta, while dogs are the strongest class.
I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.

Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.

Yup, cats are the haxorz. We pown your brain. But hey if it wasn't for stray cats we would be plauged by vermin.

so glad you mentioned toxoplasma. will you cover more parasite builds?
Can you talk about the mantis shrimp class
Can you do a honeybadger build video. Good atk. Great defense. And even poison resistance feats.
What the “Maned Wolf” class. Are the long legs an ability or some kind of model glitch.
I love the DS music.
You just blew my mind.
But you forgot what happened on the MacQuire Island server. Cats were banned, and rats crashed the server (along with rabbits, but rabbits don't grief nearly as hard as rats). Seabird players at least at least had a fighting chance with cat players, but cats are a hard-counter against rats. And trust me, if any player can crash a server, it is rats.\n\nGranted, the concern was the feral cat subclass as opposed to the outdoor cat playthrough, but similar effects either way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gqOzTh2pjEw?t=12m27s
A look at where Bears and its sub-classes fit in the meta would be interesting.
My dog is ok but my cat is an asshole is this some kind of game
Man I know its hard work but I really wish you uploaded more, these are awesome.
You forgot to talk about the cats' primary support ability, their purr, which only support builds and a few offensive builds can spec into at all. It's one of the few abilities that provides a heal, and it's an AoE heal at that, on top of its other benefits. It's insanely broken.

This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
Have you considered making a twitter and posting images of the tier lists you've done as well as maybe a sidebit or extra piece of analysis on a specific class that otherwise wouldn't make sense in a video?

What makes the human build almost game breaking in the current meta
But what about the cats that work for humans??  IE: ship cats that control rodent populations on ships. Or cats that control rodent populations in exchange for affection? Why would cats bring owners their food? Also, cats were originally a team style build (see: lions). They live in “colonies” that support each other much like wolf packs.

While the available builds are yet to be optimized, if you create a Mineralia character, robot guild is looking like it'll be pretty good as far as support classes go.\n\nIncidentally, would you mind discussing the now-removed pterosaur guild, and what it brought to the table in terms of how to get a high-weight (and potentially high-power, see also the legendary Hatzegopteryx build) build while retaining and optimizing the flight ability?

So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.\n\nDo you think this ability has any real use or effect in the current meta ?\n\nJan 27, 2003\nWhy do cats purr? - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/
This should *actually* be a real game.
I love your videos mate, keep it up !
I don’t understand why human mains even have support classes, I mean they are REALLY over powered. True human’s base and max strength is by no means the most threatening in the game but the devs gave human mains a way to high intelligence. Not only this but if humans speck even more into intelligence (especially with the “school” side quests) they can not only build homes that are practically impossible for any other players besides rat/mouse and insect mains to enter; plus the new Computer Buff they added just a little while ago human mains can practically watch the rest of us whenever they want. What I said here was barely even the tip of the ice berg, basically humans need a major debuff soon.\n- sincerely a sword fish main

Cats actually make pretty good support for humans. Throughout the game they've helped humans get rid of pest problems, such as mice and other rodents, who try to steal their food. And during Dark Age expansion, a lot of human players would have survived the bubonic plague if they didn't kill cats. See humans were affected by paranoia at the time and associated cats with the supernatural. They killed cats thinking it would prevent the sickness from spreading, when in actuality it did the opposite. If cats weren't hunted down at the time, they would have killed more rodents, the carriers of the plague, which would have lead to less human players getting wiped.
I need help. I started a party with both a Cat and Dog on my Human main thinking it would be new meta. But both players just cant work together which lead to me having to carry the team with no proper support. Your video made me consider ditching the Cat player but my character is already infected by the toxoplasma passive. What do I do?

I'm not too much of the creative type but I would love to see a video done about chimps monkeys and other primates
Can you talk about the highest and lowest tier characters?
Ugh, that toxoplasmosis nonsense is ridiculously overplayed. And talk about bias, what about cats not being banned on Middle Eastern servers?
The Khajiit has wares if you have the coin
Great video, dude. I was curious about the best common support class for human players. I've seen some go with less-than-common supports that really don't seem like they actually fit as supports, but allow the human plays to absolutely excel in certain servers, primarily when they're under-equipped. You ever seen a human with the street vendor prestige with a panther or jaguar playing support? There's a very popular video showcasing one of these players with a fucking lion support in south africa. Try to gank that guy, I'd dare you!\n\nOne thing that's really strange to me is why anyone would actively play mosquito. They've got to be the lowest tier out of all the insect players, somewhere lower than E tier. Their natural predators don't even require them for their own playthroughs! The devs could totally wipe all mosquito players from the game, banning them permenantly, and the only class that would even notice would be the human players. That's a level beyond low tier if I've ever seen it. Even housefly players aren't that useless. What does a mosquito main even do all day? They have some of the shortest playthroughs I can even think of and are less effective at making an actual change in the meta than something like yersinia pestis players, who you'll remember damn near banned humans from the european continent earlier this season (of course that was with great help from rat players and there's a huge debate on whether or not it would've even been possible without the rat flea mains) \n\nAnyway I look forward to more of your analysis of the current meta. You're clearly quite familiar with a lot of the mechanics of the game.
There are couple builds that are suporisingly vital for the current meta:\nBees keep 85% of all servers flowers going,\nBats keep pest-insect -players at bay by harassing 99% of their builds &\nWhale-players' excerement keep certain CO2-eating -alagaes alive, thus indirectly keeping the new Climate Change-event at bay (well at least slows it). (Information from science-magazine Tieteen Kuvalehti) Then there are also vulture-players, that by devouring carcasses prevent some diseases from spreading to thr rest of the server.\n\nI'd be happy to hear about these true MVP-builds!\n\nThanks for stupid/smart/original content!
Do the human build,It’s what I main and I’m kind of just sitting in a Jai-I mean school,and Ist really boring.
The next patch, Tremors of Yellowstone looks to be a blast.
Dang RuneScape soundtrack in the beginning brings back so much memories
I kinda wish some company would actually make a game where you can actually play on the entire earth as different species like the stuff you do on your channel
Why are bees S tier?
if you want to choose a really good dog build, I suggest the Black Russian Terrier, they will work much more like a bear, they were trained initially to chase escaping prisoners from Gulags, they will present the strength and the likeliness of a bear, and still keep all  the strengths of a dog.
Do an insect tier list.
Cats are junglers or a damage support, while dogs are heavily reliant on their human carry to progress, while when multiple cat plahers have a lazy human player they can still strive and also cats scaling in the African servers are broken and dominate the meta
Ok so dogs _can_ be useful with specialty skill sets (even though they're usually only companions) however it's important to realize the overall cost to the human player. A dog is like having a perpetual child who is very needy, drawn toward self-destructive behaviors, and makes messes readily (often unintentionally griefing their own human companions.) Cats, however, are like college students. They aren't completely independent but if you make the correct resources available, they can usually make due on their own very well. They also cause little accidental griefing comparatively and do not have the aggression buffs of most dogs so they can more easily live side by side with other players in a human-led party who they might normally consider prey (like birds and fish.)
Bat class tier \nFor mammal players that want bird perks
what about the alleged healing properties of a cat's purr? That's a pretty useful support ability.
I love your videos. I have some questions:\nIs friendly fire cannibalism?\nIn Tier zoo, if it is possible, what are Prestige class? (class you can only unlock by upping a basic class like becoming palladin after warrior).
I love these videos so much!!! Thanks for making these!!
Its funny because Tier means animal in german.
I main oxpecker and my hippo is the best tank and support so kys I don't agree so I have the rights to destroy your self esteem. Also, can u do a video just talking about the Tier because sometimes I get confused
Lol the DST soundtrack made me think I had left the game on.
Do a Pangolin Build video
Can you explain why chickens are in D while pigs are in B? More people eat chicken across the world and chickens also provide eggs while pigs only provide their meat. Chickens also grow faster and are easier to take care of. Also, why are horses in B?
Can you talk about the viability of nudibranchs and other high-aesthetic builds?
I think it would be cool to see where ant colonies fit on this... would we play as an individual or the entire colony... same with bee and termite colonies
You can play almost any class as human-support.  I just came back from the snakes video, thinking what about pets?  I main Ball Python, my character is the most boopable snek in the world!~
I remember the days of when the horse was way too op. The human group called mongols destroyed other human players using horse players as supports. They were way too op.
Hey,can you make a insects guide,the bee and mosquito/wasp are like the pistol srimph,all DPS but are kinda of a support too!look at the bee,it has a stinger and armor,looks like a great bruiser build,dosnt it??well,human player farm them for the honey consumable and the wax crafting material,and are one of the few classes that SINERGISES with plant kindom players,and look  at the mosquito,similar,and supports a DPS class:the Malaria build,giving them a GIGANTIC spd boost and the the ability to go though skin buff,giving the GIGANTIC DoT on human players is so fun!make a guide on them,NOW!!
What you say about Cats is true, but imprecise. Remember back in the Bronze Age days when Mice and other species griefed Humans' crops? Before Human players realised they were the absolute top-tier class? I remember when Cats in most Egypt servers were extremely popular, employed to hunt vermin and protect the crops, so much so that it became a meme religion akin to twitch's Helix Fossil; then again, a good 90% of Egypt servers' religion was based on class memes, and you could even argue that it was born out of Toxoplasma Gondiis' trolling.\n\nAfter BA was over, Cat memes got old and were particularly hated in Europe servers during Medieval Age. Black Cats were particularly hated, and most of the time their Human supportees were unreasonably hunted down simply for collaborating even once. I mean, I know those memes were bad, I still remember them, but why kill other Human players over them, even the newbies?\n\nThen that became a meme and luckly unfunny class memes came to a stop, for a while at least.\n\nNowadays Cat supports aren't used anymore in crop farming (AKA farm farming) because we have better Farmer weapons and skills for Humans in 1stWC servers along with P2W consumables to protect the crops, but if it wasn't for TPG existing and Cats lacking CC, they would be the absolute top-tier support/hunter hybrid class.\n\nI'm a Chow Chow support Dog main btw. Sorry if this comment sounded biased.
You're growing so fast, when you grow even more hopefully some game company will help you actually make the game. Would be awesome
I'm really curious about the Abyssal Plane servers and their meta. I've heard there is this weird class called a Blobfish.
While the available builds are yet to be optimized, if you create a Mineralia character, robot guild is looking like it'll be pretty good as far as support classes go.\n\nIncidentally, would you mind discussing the now-removed pterosaur guild, and what it brought to the table in terms of how to get a high-weight (and potentially high-power, see also the legendary Hatzegopteryx build) build while retaining and optimizing the flight ability?
We need capybara and the slime mold
You should have a video about which overpowered builds (for their niche) should be nerfed
Watching this as a have 1 cat laying on my legs and another sleeping around my neck/head, I feel like I might be a tad biased.
How about looking at the past meta at oceanic preds. How they rised & fell and if there might be hold outs still refusing to quit.\n\nAlso might be interesting if the devs might bring back some of these builds since there have been possible leaks of some subclasses returning to the current meta.
Explain the immortal jelly and how it has been breaking the meta for as long as it existed!
Could you do an analysis of the arachnid tier?
I need a build for a Hippo, and i'd also like to know the canine tier list to see if my fennec fox is meta right now.
I'm interested in your opinion of the viability of the blue ringed octopus build
What about the cervidae builds?
So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.\n\nDo you think this ability has any real use or effect in the current meta ?\n\nJan 27, 2003\nWhy do cats purr? - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/
This should *actually* be a real game.
I love your videos mate, keep it up !
I don’t understand why human mains even have support classes, I mean they are REALLY over powered. True human’s base and max strength is by no means the most threatening in the game but the devs gave human mains a way to high intelligence. Not only this but if humans speck even more into intelligence (especially with the “school” side quests) they can not only build homes that are practically impossible for any other players besides rat/mouse and insect mains to enter; plus the new Computer Buff they added just a little while ago human mains can practically watch the rest of us whenever they want. What I said here was barely even the tip of the ice berg, basically humans need a major debuff soon.\n- sincerely a sword fish main
I've noticed in my marine play throughs I've come across supportive microbial classes. I was just wondering at how available this class is to regular players since I've always started my upgrade tree past unicellular. I want to try and spec into algae, but I don't know where to start.
Aren't you concerned that the video might be taken down for the music?
I dont know how you only have so low subs. Your content is so well written and displayed! I literaly have shown your videos to everyone on my college so dont worry the word will spread quick!
Cats actually make pretty good support for humans. Throughout the game they've helped humans get rid of pest problems, such as mice and other rodents, who try to steal their food. And during Dark Age expansion, a lot of human players would have survived the bubonic plague if they didn't kill cats. See humans were affected by paranoia at the time and associated cats with the supernatural. They killed cats thinking it would prevent the sickness from spreading, when in actuality it did the opposite. If cats weren't hunted down at the time, they would have killed more rodents, the carriers of the plague, which would have lead to less human players getting wiped.
Is the Mantis Shrimp an S tier class?
Please do a honey badger video they're such cute little deadly devils
Have you heard about the word?
Says dogs are the top of the meta\n\nGoes on to explain how cats are actually the top of the meta, while dogs are the strongest class.
I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I need help. I started a party with both a Cat and Dog on my Human main thinking it would be new meta. But both players just cant work together which lead to me having to carry the team with no proper support. Your video made me consider ditching the Cat player but my character is already infected by the toxoplasma passive. What do I do?
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.
WARNING⚠️\n\n\nIn the comments you will find:\n99% People writing essays about why cats are better that have also Never owned a dog \n1% this comment
Talk about bears and raccoons.  Please shit on how awful pandas are
Could you do one on eusocial insects? What tier are fire ants? I'm planning on playing as a fire ant colony for my next playthrough.
I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.

This channel is done incredibly well, fantastic job! Easily one of my top 3 channels. I'm stoked about upcoming content.\n\nIf we are allowed to make request, I'd love to see birds of prey. Recently did a falconry tour and it was one of the most amazing experiences I've had.
The second I read this title in my notification, I started to giggle.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I respectfully disagree with people about a cats  independence/pride not having value in a support class. Yes dogs builds can do many things for humans that cats builds will never be able to do but how much is that needed by the average human overall? Dogs unfortunately need a huge amount of  maintenance daily and otherwise.\n1 food\n2 grooming, \n3 walks\n4 training\n5  space\n6 healthcare\n7 entertainment  \n8 affection \n9 time \nall this can be quit daunting to a human who just needs a moral boost and/ or some cuddling but  not so much time to support a support class. this make the cat a great choice for many stressed overworked people.\ncats do need daily maintenance but compared to the dog there is no contest.\n\n1 food independence bonus!If outdoors cat build may find food and feed themselves \n2 grooming independence bonus self grooming! *not all build types apply recommend scratch post for nail care to nullify the home degrade from cat scratch.  \n3 walks  independence bonus self walking human not needed\n4 training independence penalty! you want me do what? f that I ain't your slave. independence bonus No potty training needed! If i hide my waste in this sandbox no one will ever  know  \n5 space 'independence bonus! yard not needed\n6 healthcare needs same support \n7entertaninmet needs same support\n8 affection needs same support\n9 time independence bonus flexible time needs! time reduction up to 50% or more!
Cats vs Dogs? You mean BB gun vs M16?
if toxiplasmosis is as strong as you say, why is it that you give all of the credit to the dog class and none to the cat class?\n\nI wonder if dogs have a hidden status effect that caused the imbalance in this video :thinking:
How would one go about a meerkat build?
You are a dog person eh?  Cats help with mice and vermin by removing them from the area (saving food stores), and provide a healing buff with a purr move.... this creates a regen that affects the cat and any creature in contact with it.  I hope you see this because the purr move is the only reason why I spec'd my noobs as cat builds.  Dog builds do not have any regen abilities... and they require more effort out of players that spec'd as human.
Can we get an arachnid video?
Can you do a video on the Kangaroo class? I feel like it’s a good class but I just don’t know how to use it well.
.. I love this so much....how did I never know these existed? And I'm sporting Cat x3 + Dog x1 +... wait do pet turkey's count? They're wild but I feed them occasionally...
Every person that wants him to be biased to cats: HE'S BIASED TOWARDS DOGS, CATS HAVE SAVED HUMANS FROM INTRUDERS IN 2 CASES IN HISTORY AND COMAS!!!!!I!I!III!!II
Does that make the cat a parasite?
How should I go about building my bacteria class?
Can you do a tier list on the ants. The one species that is everywhere you go no matter what
Since Halloween is coming up could you talk about the controversial Ghost builds?
Could you talk about the bear class?
I think this video is a tad bias,  but it's ok. Adblock😎
so... cats are too good at other things to be the true best support class.
I thought this was for real life, then I thought he was talking about a video game, then then I thought he was talking about real life in a video game... I’m so confuzzled
Why was the snake not listed in the human support tier list?  Are you saying snakes aren't real pets?  But IDC, it's still a great video!
Im glad such a unique underated channel is getting some spotlight and is tending.
Id like to know more about the leaf cutter or ant meta in general

When everyone gets salty because the cats aren't the strongest support class.
What the fuck is going on in this video?
What about the tier list for the North American server?
You need to remember pure support classes. Cats and dogs can both play independent of humans but what about classes that support the microbiome? Humans can survive without cats dogs and other macro-scale classes but micro-scale classes are inherently necessary to their continued dominance. Of course this also affects most other players in the entire game from micro to macro so if you're analyzing around the human perspective then perhaps it's not necessary to highlight, but it's important to remember that these classes form the backbone of any and all macro-scale strategies.
True pro humans have both cats and dogs as supports. Lots of maintenance, but the payoff is ridiculous.
Do a video on the Axolotl
I still like cats
Man, the salt from catfuckers is glorious. Can't even handle shitposting if it mentions the catshit from which toxo plasmosis is spread.
Talk to me when you make a dragon guide, smh to many plebs maxing fire breathe everyone knows you max wings then scales then fire
Great content! Support classes are among my favorites.\n\nCould you explore the current rodent meta?  There are a lot of interesting and diverse specialized builds, considering they almost uniformly revolve around the (probably OP) constantly growing incisors.  \n\nAlso, how are capybara players able to spec into such a unique ability as serenity aura?  They can befriend other players with startling ease.  Is there some wololo ayoyoyo at work, or is this just playstyle?  Inquiring minds want to know.
Hey, a friend of mine swears by the tarantula specs, but I'm not sure I'm sold on the arachnid guild or if I can get past how creepy it would look. Is a arachnid build really viable?
Now let's talk about the worst class\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman,i mean we smart but not smart enough to figure out that we should stop killing each other damn griefers(also human builds have a load of debuffs)
You should do one based on some of the stranger characters like say duck-billed platypus,  Narwals, Sea Pigs,  anything else thats just kinda bizarre
love the use of the dont starve sound track
Talk about the best survival builds
First time here and its great
So glad that your videos made it to trending so that other people can see your beautiful work, keep it going man 👍
The price hike for Daraprim was for insurance companies. People can get it for really cheap.
I'd like to see you cover the banning of the Dodo Bird, it's something I don't know much about and would love to hear your take on it.
What about ranged classes? \n\n\nEtc spitting cobras spray venom to their opponent causing victims health to keep draining until death unless the opponent is too big which is usually not the case because in the desert servers (which is where they live) the opponents are usually small enough for death usually that's their main attack but if that doesn't work they aren't afraid to bite you with the same effects \n\n\n\nElement venom \nIntelligence: 40\nStealth: 70\nDefence-low (but high for its size) so: 20\nSpeed- once again low (but high for its size): 30\nHP:20\n\nAnother ranged class is the Egyptian vulture.\nEgyptian vultures pick up rocks into the air using the move flight which utilizes the air element to lift it up in the air.After the vultures pick up the stones in the air they drop the stones on eggs (an earth element move) with tough shells killing their opponents before the baby stage reducing competition but the vultures had to develop high intelligence for that sometimes they just pick up the stone and start hammering at the egg without even flying into the air.\n\nSpeed:80\nStealth:80\nAttack:30\nDefence:25\nIntelligence:80\nHP:30
Can you mention Axolotl mains and give them a few pointers? I'm not one, but I was considering wiping my previous account as a fox to try something with better health retention.
Everyone’s joking about having real classes while I’m still sitting here scarred by the dogs and cats friggin murdering anything they see
This video is on trending! Well deserved, it will get more subs! I subbed when the channel had ~15k subs. 👌
What tier is best for jungle?
Cats are the embodiement of PvP players. Selfish as hell and cheat wherever they can. Dogs form thier APvP guild to contain the cats, then get baged by dog catchers. Wow games really do model real life sometimes.
I've been looking forward to your analysis of dogs since your first video
Talk about the platypus (also I think you could revisit this topic)
You should look into the balancing of different reproductive systems. Seems completely unbalanced that some classes have to camp their own spawn point to defend against griefers for months just because they have the egg skill tree when others get the incredibly easy budding ability.
Hey so are you ever gonna cover how massively unbalanced the Human players are? When are they gonna get nerfed? They are basically playing their own game at this point.
Will you make a video discussing the importance of the defensive meta and name some specific animals that follow this build?
So dogs are good for combo attacks and cats are the healers so cats are mercy(I think that's the healers name I don't know lol)and dogs are bastion,mcree and sometimes genji
This is why I don't raid with cats, Their toxoplasma parasite infects the group as well as the main boss which leads to unfair distribution of DKP. Always in their favor :(
Blue collar humans and White collar humans
What if the devs make a Mars expansion pack? Which tiers will do well on that map?
Since you did big cats can you do canines too? I know hyenas are more related to cats but could you add em in too if you do? Thanks LOVE YOUR VIDS
Mitochondria are the best support class. Nobody in there right mind would play without one on there team.
For the dog you forgot about recognizing invisible desieses and alerting their handler
I think it's time for a video on the number 1 undisputed SSS tier human, perhaps a  light recap of guild conflicts would be interesting (tier history series when??)
#17 Trending. Congrats for making it, and definitely lookong forawrd to what's next.
Dogs: Look at this team! We're gonna do great!\n\nCats; I need healing!
Cats have some of the best escape in the game in their climbing ability and acrobatic movement.\nBeing unable to reach the same levels of pure physical power doesn't matter because a cat can simply escape whenever its in a bad matchup, unlike a dog.
When you realize you're #20 on trending, wow great moves keep it up proud of you
i don't believe in the conspiracy, it might play a small part  but its probably cats because tribes helped them cause the kill mice that eat grain, so they were a support class but not any more.

I have a problem. I initially thought being a fish player was a good idea, but ultimately decided to make a switch. I want to make a switch to Megatherium, but my game always seems to crash when I try. I was wondering if you could make a video going over how to build with Sloths, or even how to build with the Megatherium (if my game stops crashing when I try to make one.) It would be incredibly helpful.
It's so obvious when someone is a dog main. :/\n\nCooking up conspiracy theories for why cats are such a high-ranked support class when even back in pre-release, cats remain THE most effective check for griefing mouse, rat, bird, mole, and even some lizard builds. Human players aren't really specced to handle those classes, never have been. For one thing, the larger build size of humans making it easy for smaller builds like the rodent class to easily evade them by retreating to terrain where bigger builds can't follow, allowing them to actually establish spawn points within a human player's territory and also sneak into human bases and steal valuable drops and resources directly from their storage containers. Plus, humans just dumped way too many stats into INT and its skill trees, and failed to go deep enough into the Perception skill tree to pick up on the heightened hearing, sense of smell, or even night vision perks that would help negate the lower tier classes' ability to grief them. Yeah, humans may dominate the current meta in terms of their influence on the meta itself, but the fact is that there will always be a thousand low-level players for every high-level one - and if the low-level players can grief the high-level players through sheer numbers, without being checked, that gradual erosion on the high tier player is going to start showing more and more of an effect.\n\nEnter, my friends, the cat class.\n\nThe cat class, as you noted, never made the switch from their assassin role to a support role. Why, then, are they considered a S tier support class? It's simple - the cat class never made the switch to a support role because it didn't need to. Its abilities as a stealth assassin class are exactly what human players needed, and so human players started pairing with cat players exactly as they were. The cat class comes STANDARD with all the abilities required to handle the numerous low-tier griefers that human players simply aren't equipped to, and any cat player playing solo will already BE tackling those griefers because it's the most logical, natural playstyle for anyone who specs into the class to begin with. What else are you going to do with all those stealth and attack points, especially at that build size? And then a human player comes along, sees what your class can do(that theirs can't, but desperately needs), and offers you a mutually beneficial arrangement where it shares its resources with you, in exchange for your doing exactly what you were already doing - just in their territory. Like I said, you can look back through past versions of the game all the way back to pre-1.0 and see this logic at work, with cat and human players teaming up as early as the Ancient Egyptian expansion.\n\nAnd all this is talking purely in terms of PVP game mechanics, and how the cat class helps shore up the human class' weakness to griefing. I'm not even getting into the fact that the cat class has aesthetic values of its own, or how they've invested points in the vocalization tree to communicate more effectively with human players - it's an essentially worthless perk when dealing with any other class, even other cat players - or their own INT stats that sometimes let them spec into other skills - even some normally associated with the dog class. I haven't even brought up the Purr perk, which - aside from being considered soothing by many players - actually comes with a small but not insignificant regen buff.\n\nSo who really needs to explain it as a conspiracy theory involving a cat-bacteria support relationship somehow manipulating human players, when there's such obvious logic to this team dynamic? It's blatant dog class bias. Especially when the article you cite shows that it's an estimate of BETWEEN 30-50% have been exposed to T. gondii, and MAY have been infected. So that's not a guarantee of how many human players have been infected, even the percentage of exposed human players could be as much as 20% lower as you state aloud(meaning you're skewing high on purpose), and - at MAXIMUM - you've only accounted for half of all human players. It also ignores the fact that for a human player to acquire the T. gondii debuff, they have to already HAVE exposure to the cat class. Isn't it logical to assume that the support pairing may have pre-dated the application of the debuff, then? After all, how would human players be getting the debuff if they had no reason to associate with the cat class to begin with?\n\nThis also ignores the statistics that - based on the statistics of US players alone - 36% of human players team up with dogs, and 30% of human players team up with cats. So for all those scare tactic statistics, human-cat support teams are LESS numerous than human-dog support teams! But I guess the popularity of the dog class is just because they're just that amazing, right? (And, to be fair - they are. No hate to any dog mains out there; I can't argue with the facts that dogs are practically OP as a support build. I'm just tired of people sleeping on the fact that the cat class have EARNED their place in S tier, as much as the dog class has...and it always seems to be dog class stans who act like the cat class cheated its way to the top.) And, of course, this is assuming that out of the MAYBE 50% of human players there are who have the T. gondii debuff, all 100% of human-cat support teams fall within that tentative 50%. That seems pretty statistically unlikely, doesn't it?\n\nIt's pretty telling that the same player who made the video about all the positive qualities of the feline builds somehow forgot all the virtues of those builds when talking about the feline build that ~happens~ to be in direct competition with another popular support build...I'm not saying the T. gondii debuff is completely insignificant, but when that's the only aspect of the build you focus on, it stops being a 'VS' video and becomes a fluff piece for your favorite class because there's no genuine comparison being made. :/ Disappointing.
Iguana is the true support meta. It's the only service animal issued to counteract the dreaded 'crippling depression' debuff.\n\nToxoplasma and enemy detection are no good if your human party leader went and ate the business end of a shotgun while you're stuck in the house.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I started as a human how do I restart?
First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\n\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\n\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\n\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.
that yellowstone reference killed me
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
not sure if this even gets to you with almost 4k comments, just wanne say good choice of music and really good video keep it up
But what about the cats that work for humans??  IE: ship cats that control rodent populations on ships. Or cats that control rodent populations in exchange for affection? Why would cats bring owners their food? Also, cats were originally a team style build (see: lions). They live in “colonies” that support each other much like wolf packs.
Please make a video on flies
What game is that?
Please talk about the MANTIS SHRIMP! It's claws move like a .22 caliber rifle and it can boil water just by moving.
how about a video on the viable bat builds
Dog maining elitist here forgot to mention how cat's make great defensive units when you're hoarding resources, and also boost immunity to certain diseases.  They have a strong morale boosting AOE, but the strength has a greater variability than the dog class.  Overall, their stats tend to vary more.  In some cases they can even exceed that of a dog.
Have you considered talking about  deep sea animals for Halloween?
See, cats purr. Can dogs purr? No. That is why cats are better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy cat hates me. I pet her too much
The cat and dog classes are pretty good with their own reasons but nothing can beat a falcon’s air strike. Air strike takes quite some leveling up to get but once you get it, it becomes overkill. I like to pair air strike with bird eyes for increased accuracy.
Many say the sea cucumber is man's best friend.

Please talk about the meta between rival ant teams?
Give us a dive gorilla build
I'm waiting for the sloth video, the most troll build in the game. Sloths offer great stealth and are so unattractive that very few other players even consider killing it. While the movement seems very basic there are a lot of aspects to master, today we see a lot of sloth players randomly dropping from trees and thus killing themselves. Definitely F tier but a highly interesting PvE build choice.
If it wasn't for cats, our ancestors would have all died of plague when humans began building cities. You know, because large stores of grain attract disease ridden rodents.
You say stole the top spot. I say Cats achieved the top spot. Survival of the fittest, b. Not a felines fault they managed to domesticated humans without having to learn stupid tricks. If dogs were smarter, they could have...lol. No, they couldn't.\n\nCats have always been, and will always be the supreme winners.
You think we could either get a human subclass tier list or a multipart bacterial one
Hey, um, microverse server player here (tuberculosis, yes I hated the antibiotics buff humans got), and I was wondering if the virus class is actually playable? I see them everywhere but they don't appear in the character creation menu. Are they even a playable class?
Dogs have an actual use cats just eat food and give no shits

Everyone is talking about which class is better. Cat or dog? Welp, the answer is simple. If you get Positive support classes, you can have both. Not only do I reap the benefits of purr, I also get the protection of Bark.\n\nWhy choose one support style when you can have both!
What about parrot builds? I'm trying to figure out the pros and cons of all the builds and I need some help.
i wouldn't dream about EVER being forced to choose. I wouldn't tolerat it becuz its like choosing between ur children. They both thoroughly allow my heart all the magic it can hold...and MORE. Hellfire, I need some horses too, chickens maybe, throw in cpl turtles, i want a zoo. The more---the better. Life is all that better.
I would love to hear about mollusks in the meta. Specifically why gastropods like snails are so low on the tier list.
Dogs are much more work but a better support class
87 intelligence for dogs? ..... wow. I mean they are very lovable, but if you look at nature dogs really don't cut the mustard when it comes to intelligence. They are kind of not that high to be honest.
I like the don't starve soundtrack.
You forgot to mention many of cats unique abilities. Like being able to use way points and access to online maps to navigate back home no matter where a cat winds up. Or their passive ability that some spec into like ESP. Emotional sensor patrol.
Human and a whale shark build makes a overpowered aquarium,\n also do a build on alpacas.
Friendly reminder that users are stupid and will delete cat characters over the toxoplasmosis meme.\n\nPlease don't casually perpetuate it, dog mains.
I'm confused about my new build. I play a Cassowary, and I'm not sure how I should play.
Your channel is the first one I've ever supported on Patreon your content is amazing.
Can you talk about the parasite vs. commensal vs. support (mutualism) builds and which is best? Also a video about how cows are lowkey just giant exosymbiotic parasites of the bacteria living inside them would be awesome (only doing 20% of their own digestion, are you kidding me?).
The bird tier list. Make it happen.
I think an analysis of the megafauna trait would be fun and interesting
Please make a video about rat builds and their possibilities
Could you cover how humans have become more and more overpowered in recent patches?
just wondering, is there anything planned on ants?
Dog players actually have little to no control in how they want to spec, you are at the mercy of your human player.
Can we go over how the Human's two main passives, Craft and Augment, as well as its extremely high IQ stat have made it an undisputed top tier unit despite having mid to low HP, atk, def and stealth?
Nope cats are life cats help like u said but they also are the only self domesticated animal on the earth aka they CHOSE to stay with humans
Dog, if you want to care for a mammal that will love you in return for caring. Cat, if you're lonely and want a furry buddy nearby, and just want to set the food and water out.
Curious how Bear builds are doing in the meta. I’m considering maining one but I’m not sure what I want to spec
Can you give some advice on the platypus build?
The platypus is where it's at.
I was watching those videos for a month or so, and just now I understood the joke: tier means beast in German.
I would argue that in the current game meta, cats are the far superior support class. \nNot only do they grant the same initial buff that dog players do, but they also unlock the regeneration buff “Purr” \nIf you choose an inside or outside style cat player, you are also granted guarantees to a disease free guild hall caused by other low tier players such as rodents and birds. Much more effective in the most recent meta as the dog players “hunting” ability is much less needed with the current tech upgrades \nIt’s also interesting to note that while almost any cat class breed will grant the same buffs, not all dog class breeds will have the same effectiveness regarding the higher level buffs they have access to. \nCat classes also require much less player maintenance than dog classes, especially when choosing the outside cat class. \nAnother big thing to consider when looking at Support classes is the amount of time needed to reach specific buffs and the longevity of the support class chosen. While it can take years for dog classes to reach their max potential, cat classes main features are accessed within a few months. Dog classes also have an effective life span of 7-11 years of you choose the proper breed, while cats will remain good Support classes for up to 18 years or older. \n\nWhile the dog class has a lot of fancy buffs a human player can cultivate and gain access to, if you look at the time needed, the effectiveness in the current meta, the maintenance of he support class, and the life span of your companion, there really is no competition.
What purpose do hedgehogs have in their server?
Man I really wish they would turn tier zoo into a real game series.
Brb euthanising both my cats in favour of dog class.
I would like to see your tier placement of the Common Raven. Maybe along with the Elephant and Killer Whale as intelligent, social animals. I believe those three are top tier S class that inhabit Air, Land, and Sea.
What are your favorite builds?
Time to purge the cat class.
This is God damn genius!!!!!!!
Yeah, you have to train a dog for all those buffs. Doesn’t count
The music choices you used are amazing.
The runescape music in the beginning gave me nostalgia
D I S L I K E.
You should talk about the arthropod guild. the spider and insect classes have immense prevalence in the meta and ignoring them would be a mistake.
Would you ever think of splitting mobility into speed and dexterity?\nAlso, would someone care to explain the difference between defense and hp? I understand defense is kinda like armor but would there be a case of an animal with high hp and terrible defense or one with high defense and low hp?
Lmao teammates? You mean servants lol

To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
Please do a honey badger video they're such cute little deadly devils

I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.

I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
What about the fast that cats help keep the rodent players from griefing human storages?
I feel so cheesy playing the Human class.
You mentioned Bat builds in your previous video but haven't actually gone in depth with them, I'm thinking on starting one up but want to know what I'm getting into first
Yup, cats are the haxorz. We pown your brain. But hey if it wasn't for stray cats we would be plauged by vermin.

I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on

Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
so glad you mentioned toxoplasma. will you cover more parasite builds?
Can you talk about the mantis shrimp class
Can you do a honeybadger build video. Good atk. Great defense. And even poison resistance feats.
What the “Maned Wolf” class. Are the long legs an ability or some kind of model glitch.
I love the DS music.
You just blew my mind.
But you forgot what happened on the MacQuire Island server. Cats were banned, and rats crashed the server (along with rabbits, but rabbits don't grief nearly as hard as rats). Seabird players at least at least had a fighting chance with cat players, but cats are a hard-counter against rats. And trust me, if any player can crash a server, it is rats.\n\nGranted, the concern was the feral cat subclass as opposed to the outdoor cat playthrough, but similar effects either way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gqOzTh2pjEw?t=12m27s
A look at where Bears and its sub-classes fit in the meta would be interesting.
My dog is ok but my cat is an asshole is this some kind of game
Man I know its hard work but I really wish you uploaded more, these are awesome.
You forgot to talk about the cats' primary support ability, their purr, which only support builds and a few offensive builds can spec into at all. It's one of the few abilities that provides a heal, and it's an AoE heal at that, on top of its other benefits. It's insanely broken.

So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.\n\nDo you think this ability has any real use or effect in the current meta ?\n\nJan 27, 2003\nWhy do cats purr? - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/
This should *actually* be a real game.
I love your videos mate, keep it up !
I don’t understand why human mains even have support classes, I mean they are REALLY over powered. True human’s base and max strength is by no means the most threatening in the game but the devs gave human mains a way to high intelligence. Not only this but if humans speck even more into intelligence (especially with the “school” side quests) they can not only build homes that are practically impossible for any other players besides rat/mouse and insect mains to enter; plus the new Computer Buff they added just a little while ago human mains can practically watch the rest of us whenever they want. What I said here was barely even the tip of the ice berg, basically humans need a major debuff soon.\n- sincerely a sword fish main

Talk about bears and raccoons.  Please shit on how awful pandas are
Could you do one on eusocial insects? What tier are fire ants? I'm planning on playing as a fire ant colony for my next playthrough.
I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Cats actually make pretty good support for humans. Throughout the game they've helped humans get rid of pest problems, such as mice and other rodents, who try to steal their food. And during Dark Age expansion, a lot of human players would have survived the bubonic plague if they didn't kill cats. See humans were affected by paranoia at the time and associated cats with the supernatural. They killed cats thinking it would prevent the sickness from spreading, when in actuality it did the opposite. If cats weren't hunted down at the time, they would have killed more rodents, the carriers of the plague, which would have lead to less human players getting wiped.
I need help. I started a party with both a Cat and Dog on my Human main thinking it would be new meta. But both players just cant work together which lead to me having to carry the team with no proper support. Your video made me consider ditching the Cat player but my character is already infected by the toxoplasma passive. What do I do?
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
so glad you mentioned toxoplasma. will you cover more parasite builds?
Can you talk about the mantis shrimp class
Dog playas represent.
Can you do a honeybadger build video. Good atk. Great defense. And even poison resistance feats.
What the “Maned Wolf” class. Are the long legs an ability or some kind of model glitch.
I love the DS music.
You just blew my mind.
But you forgot what happened on the MacQuire Island server. Cats were banned, and rats crashed the server (along with rabbits, but rabbits don't grief nearly as hard as rats). Seabird players at least at least had a fighting chance with cat players, but cats are a hard-counter against rats. And trust me, if any player can crash a server, it is rats.\n\nGranted, the concern was the feral cat subclass as opposed to the outdoor cat playthrough, but similar effects either way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gqOzTh2pjEw?t=12m27s
A look at where Bears and its sub-classes fit in the meta would be interesting.
My dog is ok but my cat is an asshole is this some kind of game
Man I know its hard work but I really wish you uploaded more, these are awesome.
You forgot to talk about the cats' primary support ability, their purr, which only support builds and a few offensive builds can spec into at all. It's one of the few abilities that provides a heal, and it's an AoE heal at that, on top of its other benefits. It's insanely broken.
Fable the lost chapters music?
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
What about the fast that cats help keep the rodent players from griefing human storages?
I feel so cheesy playing the Human class.
You mentioned Bat builds in your previous video but haven't actually gone in depth with them, I'm thinking on starting one up but want to know what I'm getting into first
Yup, cats are the haxorz. We pown your brain. But hey if it wasn't for stray cats we would be plauged by vermin.
that yellowstone reference killed me
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
>Cat owners are infected with a mind virus\n>This is why my dog that eats its own shit, I have to walk every day and  barks at passing cars  at 4 am is superior
So basically cats are useless

Anemone main here, I have 5 alt accounts that I play all at the same time to compare the RNG.
This channel is done incredibly well, fantastic job! Easily one of my top 3 channels. I'm stoked about upcoming content.\n\nIf we are allowed to make request, I'd love to see birds of prey. Recently did a falconry tour and it was one of the most amazing experiences I've had.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
Don't forget about cats' purr, which accelerates healing of themselves and those very near them
I'm not too much of the creative type but I would love to see a video done about chimps monkeys and other primates
Can you talk about the highest and lowest tier characters?
Ugh, that toxoplasmosis nonsense is ridiculously overplayed. And talk about bias, what about cats not being banned on Middle Eastern servers?
The Khajiit has wares if you have the coin
Great video, dude. I was curious about the best common support class for human players. I've seen some go with less-than-common supports that really don't seem like they actually fit as supports, but allow the human plays to absolutely excel in certain servers, primarily when they're under-equipped. You ever seen a human with the street vendor prestige with a panther or jaguar playing support? There's a very popular video showcasing one of these players with a fucking lion support in south africa. Try to gank that guy, I'd dare you!\n\nOne thing that's really strange to me is why anyone would actively play mosquito. They've got to be the lowest tier out of all the insect players, somewhere lower than E tier. Their natural predators don't even require them for their own playthroughs! The devs could totally wipe all mosquito players from the game, banning them permenantly, and the only class that would even notice would be the human players. That's a level beyond low tier if I've ever seen it. Even housefly players aren't that useless. What does a mosquito main even do all day? They have some of the shortest playthroughs I can even think of and are less effective at making an actual change in the meta than something like yersinia pestis players, who you'll remember damn near banned humans from the european continent earlier this season (of course that was with great help from rat players and there's a huge debate on whether or not it would've even been possible without the rat flea mains) \n\nAnyway I look forward to more of your analysis of the current meta. You're clearly quite familiar with a lot of the mechanics of the game.
There are couple builds that are suporisingly vital for the current meta:\nBees keep 85% of all servers flowers going,\nBats keep pest-insect -players at bay by harassing 99% of their builds &\nWhale-players' excerement keep certain CO2-eating -alagaes alive, thus indirectly keeping the new Climate Change-event at bay (well at least slows it). (Information from science-magazine Tieteen Kuvalehti) Then there are also vulture-players, that by devouring carcasses prevent some diseases from spreading to thr rest of the server.\n\nI'd be happy to hear about these true MVP-builds!\n\nThanks for stupid/smart/original content!
Do the human build,It’s what I main and I’m kind of just sitting in a Jai-I mean school,and Ist really boring.
The next patch, Tremors of Yellowstone looks to be a blast.
Dang RuneScape soundtrack in the beginning brings back so much memories
I kinda wish some company would actually make a game where you can actually play on the entire earth as different species like the stuff you do on your channel
Why are bees S tier?
if you want to choose a really good dog build, I suggest the Black Russian Terrier, they will work much more like a bear, they were trained initially to chase escaping prisoners from Gulags, they will present the strength and the likeliness of a bear, and still keep all  the strengths of a dog.
Do an insect tier list.
Cats are junglers or a damage support, while dogs are heavily reliant on their human carry to progress, while when multiple cat plahers have a lazy human player they can still strive and also cats scaling in the African servers are broken and dominate the meta
Ok so dogs _can_ be useful with specialty skill sets (even though they're usually only companions) however it's important to realize the overall cost to the human player. A dog is like having a perpetual child who is very needy, drawn toward self-destructive behaviors, and makes messes readily (often unintentionally griefing their own human companions.) Cats, however, are like college students. They aren't completely independent but if you make the correct resources available, they can usually make due on their own very well. They also cause little accidental griefing comparatively and do not have the aggression buffs of most dogs so they can more easily live side by side with other players in a human-led party who they might normally consider prey (like birds and fish.)
Bat class tier \nFor mammal players that want bird perks
what about the alleged healing properties of a cat's purr? That's a pretty useful support ability.
I love your videos. I have some questions:\nIs friendly fire cannibalism?\nIn Tier zoo, if it is possible, what are Prestige class? (class you can only unlock by upping a basic class like becoming palladin after warrior).
I love these videos so much!!! Thanks for making these!!
Its funny because Tier means animal in german.
I main oxpecker and my hippo is the best tank and support so kys I don't agree so I have the rights to destroy your self esteem. Also, can u do a video just talking about the Tier because sometimes I get confused
Lol the DST soundtrack made me think I had left the game on.
Do a Pangolin Build video
Can you explain why chickens are in D while pigs are in B? More people eat chicken across the world and chickens also provide eggs while pigs only provide their meat. Chickens also grow faster and are easier to take care of. Also, why are horses in B?
Can you talk about the viability of nudibranchs and other high-aesthetic builds?
I think it would be cool to see where ant colonies fit on this... would we play as an individual or the entire colony... same with bee and termite colonies
You can play almost any class as human-support.  I just came back from the snakes video, thinking what about pets?  I main Ball Python, my character is the most boopable snek in the world!~
I remember the days of when the horse was way too op. The human group called mongols destroyed other human players using horse players as supports. They were way too op.
Hey,can you make a insects guide,the bee and mosquito/wasp are like the pistol srimph,all DPS but are kinda of a support too!look at the bee,it has a stinger and armor,looks like a great bruiser build,dosnt it??well,human player farm them for the honey consumable and the wax crafting material,and are one of the few classes that SINERGISES with plant kindom players,and look  at the mosquito,similar,and supports a DPS class:the Malaria build,giving them a GIGANTIC spd boost and the the ability to go though skin buff,giving the GIGANTIC DoT on human players is so fun!make a guide on them,NOW!!
What you say about Cats is true, but imprecise. Remember back in the Bronze Age days when Mice and other species griefed Humans' crops? Before Human players realised they were the absolute top-tier class? I remember when Cats in most Egypt servers were extremely popular, employed to hunt vermin and protect the crops, so much so that it became a meme religion akin to twitch's Helix Fossil; then again, a good 90% of Egypt servers' religion was based on class memes, and you could even argue that it was born out of Toxoplasma Gondiis' trolling.\n\nAfter BA was over, Cat memes got old and were particularly hated in Europe servers during Medieval Age. Black Cats were particularly hated, and most of the time their Human supportees were unreasonably hunted down simply for collaborating even once. I mean, I know those memes were bad, I still remember them, but why kill other Human players over them, even the newbies?\n\nThen that became a meme and luckly unfunny class memes came to a stop, for a while at least.\n\nNowadays Cat supports aren't used anymore in crop farming (AKA farm farming) because we have better Farmer weapons and skills for Humans in 1stWC servers along with P2W consumables to protect the crops, but if it wasn't for TPG existing and Cats lacking CC, they would be the absolute top-tier support/hunter hybrid class.\n\nI'm a Chow Chow support Dog main btw. Sorry if this comment sounded biased.
You're growing so fast, when you grow even more hopefully some game company will help you actually make the game. Would be awesome
I'm really curious about the Abyssal Plane servers and their meta. I've heard there is this weird class called a Blobfish.
While the available builds are yet to be optimized, if you create a Mineralia character, robot guild is looking like it'll be pretty good as far as support classes go.\n\nIncidentally, would you mind discussing the now-removed pterosaur guild, and what it brought to the table in terms of how to get a high-weight (and potentially high-power, see also the legendary Hatzegopteryx build) build while retaining and optimizing the flight ability?
We need capybara and the slime mold
You should have a video about which overpowered builds (for their niche) should be nerfed
Watching this as a have 1 cat laying on my legs and another sleeping around my neck/head, I feel like I might be a tad biased.
How about looking at the past meta at oceanic preds. How they rised & fell and if there might be hold outs still refusing to quit.\n\nAlso might be interesting if the devs might bring back some of these builds since there have been possible leaks of some subclasses returning to the current meta.
Explain the immortal jelly and how it has been breaking the meta for as long as it existed!
Could you do an analysis of the arachnid tier?
I need a build for a Hippo, and i'd also like to know the canine tier list to see if my fennec fox is meta right now.
I'm interested in your opinion of the viability of the blue ringed octopus build
What about the cervidae builds?
So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.\n\nDo you think this ability has any real use or effect in the current meta ?\n\nJan 27, 2003\nWhy do cats purr? - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/
This should *actually* be a real game.
I love your videos mate, keep it up !
I don’t understand why human mains even have support classes, I mean they are REALLY over powered. True human’s base and max strength is by no means the most threatening in the game but the devs gave human mains a way to high intelligence. Not only this but if humans speck even more into intelligence (especially with the “school” side quests) they can not only build homes that are practically impossible for any other players besides rat/mouse and insect mains to enter; plus the new Computer Buff they added just a little while ago human mains can practically watch the rest of us whenever they want. What I said here was barely even the tip of the ice berg, basically humans need a major debuff soon.\n- sincerely a sword fish main
I've noticed in my marine play throughs I've come across supportive microbial classes. I was just wondering at how available this class is to regular players since I've always started my upgrade tree past unicellular. I want to try and spec into algae, but I don't know where to start.
Aren't you concerned that the video might be taken down for the music?
I dont know how you only have so low subs. Your content is so well written and displayed! I literaly have shown your videos to everyone on my college so dont worry the word will spread quick!

Wait so you are Executive Platinum or Platinum Pro?  If not then that's why she laughed when you said you are a platinum member.  Were you flying less than 500 miles? If you went over 500 miles you would need to pay for an upgrade as a regular Platinum member.

She just can't stay out of trouble.  Then blames white men, of course.  What a racist.

LOL at white male aggression.  How racist.  Can you imagine if that was said about a person of color?  I want to see VIDEO of the encounter.  From the ticket agent to the pilot.  I dont believe people.
Have you tried not being a cunt and see how that works out for you?
Hello Dear   I do not work AA, I work for one of the major carriers. Yes, platinum  members are entitled  to perks like upgrading. But if someone wants to pay for that seat , they have priority.  , upgrades are given out minutes before boarding . In your case if the system gave you that seat and allowed you to book it, it should have been yours. It was an error. In there part and you should have been compensated.   So
This woman is a race baiter if there ever is one.  They kicked her ass off the flight because the Pilot saw her as being a erratic fucking idiot that may be a problem.  He has that right, he doesn't have to explain himself to anyone.  He's the fucking Pilot.
I'm sure she was peaceful and polite, lol yeah right...
She is just a disenfrenchfries black woman whos showance collapse LOL
Have you tried not being a cunt and see how that works out for you?
It's called propagation.  There's other words for it. It's the time it takes for one server to update to other servers and databases.  An example is when you draw money from your bank, get home and check your account, but the withdrawal isn't there yet because your bank has a server that updates every hour or 2 hours..most should be every 5 or 10 min or instantaneously, but it is what it is. For the airline to have a kiosk that lets you edit your seating, prints you your updated ticket and then prints out a ticket  at the gate that doesn't reflect that change means they have a sorry update system.  As far as her response, I'm sure she regrets it, but something about airline travel makes people get overly emotional(this goes for airline staff as well)

Almost as good as PS4's 60 minutes recording.\nAlmost.😝
30 seconds? I'm gonna end up with a lot of wasted memo- wait you can change the length? Nevermind. Good job Nintendo. You are better than Microsoft because of the fact that you don't force us to make a 30 second recording when we only needed 3. Oh and also you make better games and DON'T sacrifice local multi-player for graphics. (looking at you halo 5).
I WAS WAITING FOR ThIS TO SHOW EVERYBODY MY SKILL ON SPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLAAAATOOOON\nAhem sorry x)
I’m looking forward to using this feature. Now I just have to think of something original.
Lets just hope the nintendo switch can be a success all its life, remember what happened to the dreamcast. Those days...
That’s awesome but still waiting for Nintendo to release an update where they ENABLE BLUETOOTH for audio devices. I want to use my Bluetooth headset on the go.
Nintendo, you guys are awesome! Thank you for adding this amazing feature!
So I still have to buy something to record my switch still? Well this sucks
Well I came here thinking that they would allow you to capture long videos to post just for them to have you take them down.\nBut I guess a 30 second click posted to facebook or twitter isn't that bad... I mean unless they ask you to take those down too lol
And then have your capture immediately cease-and-desisted!
Can't upload videos on Youtube. :(
Add the virtual console ALREADY!!!
They shoul've been as long as probably 10 minutes or at least have better quality
How backlogged was this video?
Now NINTEND since your trying to be like everyone else why don't you try one more thing like everyone else and let us share with people on YouTube
Ah yes, lets give people the option to capture videos on our newest system!....except we won't let them upload it on video sharing sites!
Don't buy this rubbish👌
Wait, what? This doesn't work for ALL Switch games?! C'mon, Nintendo... :'(
It's a step in the right direction, but man they have a long way to go. I love shadowplay so much
I'm worried Nintendo is slowly turning into Microsoft
When I get a switch with splatoon 2 \n\nI’m gonna capture a video of the inkling creator
The switch is still relevant??
This is perfect!! Now if we could only post straight to instagram...
This is just a test run on video capture for the Switch. It reminds me of the Share functionality on the PS4. I don't mind the short length of 30 seconds since Nintendo plans to extend it to around 5 minutes or more in the future.
they know they can't do a whole minute because the Nintendo switch has no space
And yet, you still can’t text these pictures and videos to people on your Switch friends list...
30 seconds doesn´t seems like much, but if this gets popular enough, they´ll surely improove it.\nI mean... they found a way to record video with the 3DS so... everything is possible!
So uhhh why’s this in trending
Can you get the game planet caserster
Welp, I finished zelda and now you add this??
I think they should create Nintendo Drive app for any device. I'm sure there is a way to share on other social media sites. Like with Xbox & PlayStation. 😊
Gimme a Nintendo switch or i’ll swear on a Christian Minecraft server
Does Nintendo have something against Google and YouTube?
Great addition, Nintendo! The game recording could be a bit smoother.... but I've just tested it while undocked. But definitely want smoother videos (if possible)
this idea would have been WAAAY better if you could record for at least 30 minutes
This would be cooler if you could hit the capture button and it recorded the last 30 secs you just played, instead of recording for 30 secs after you push the button. The weirdest things happen in games when you least expect it.
I want The nintendo Switch
full of surprises not really, you guys mentioned this when you aired the console.. also.. make the video capture better 30 seconds is not enough for anyone xD
About time, so where's the Virtual Console, huh Nintendo?
This is Not Video Capture is Social Capture But Can You Make anither Video Capture Where we can Stop Recording at Any time and Don't Have to Hold the Capture Button and Like Make a Record In Settings or Stream In Settings,Please! I really want To record For Any Minutes
So its the same as xbox game dvr
This is awesome and I actually have an Elgato. Much more convenient than that of the PS4 and Xbox One. For those that think little of this, the Xbox One just recently went from a 5-minute limit to 30. I believe the PS4 is still 15 minutes. Keep in mind that both of these consoles can barely fit in a backpack while most of the memory is taken up by game installs. A single button press.
Why is only compatible with 4 games? Is that Nintendo’s way of testing and rolling out the new features?
If video can upload to youtube i think will better
Is this gonna be like smash bros, where the clips delete after each patch?
Cant we just be exited for a feature? I mean, Xbox has it, and you'll probably be able to Stream to Twitch in online 2018
I gave a thumbs up, Subscribed and Hit the bell, thanks!
yes, although it's disappointing it's only 30 seconds
I just go the update and I was excited but as soon as it was done my left joy con wouldn’t connect in tv or table top mode\n\nEdit: i even realized that I have to update my joycon and it still didn’t work
this seems pretty cool, but please nintendo. can you raise the video time at LEAST 30 more seconds?
i could care less because it doesnt even post to youtube, but if they add a youtube option to editing and posting, that would be AWESOME.
Hi can you send me one for FREEEEEEE
Why did you ban 8BitDo controllers Nintendo stop being so greedy!
Can you also record Mario + Rabbits Kindom Battle?????
Please Netflix!🤗

30 sec? i better using my phone to record that
why 30 secs wtf nintendo :(
Why just 30 seconds?
You have to pay for multiplayer ewww...  pass.
Since you can't upload to gameplay to Youtube then why are you showing us this on YouTube? Nintendo is such a hypocrite
Does this mean you wont take peoples money from posting gameplay videos or nah
30 second isn’t that bad, it’s like in Xbox when you do a moment in the last 30 seconds you can record it and your friends can see it. 30 seconds is pretty long actually. Hopefully Nintendo do something along the lines of posting it to your Nintendo account or something and can see it on your phone.
So Nintendo let's you record gameplay with the switch but if you post it to youtube they take all the revenue?  Nice.
Cool can I have normal voice chat now?
A few nitpicks:\n- 30 seconds is too short\n- YouTube should definitely be an option\n- Why 480p?\n- You should be able to record AFTER you press the button (maybe press the capture button & the d-pad at the same time?)\nI'm grateful for this feature, but it can definitely be improved on in the future
Capture a Nintendo video, post it to YouTube. Nintendo flags it, it's copyright material.\nWell lookit me. I'm a big dumb sucker! HA
30 seconds whoopee doo
this does not work
It would be better to capture at least one hour to make gameplays
30 seconds wow Nintendo is that the best you could do.....you could do better
Well lets all hope that Miiverse will come to the switch.
Dear Nintendo.I got some great ideas for the Nintendo switch updates!!!Can you guys please add a built in mic in the switch or allow any gaming headset to the switch instead of the awkward phone cables chat thing. voice chat would be easier. Also take off friend codes!it's annoying typing in codes just to get a friend. Also please don't make us pay to play online. And maybe add parties to the switch. parties are group of friends that can chat together. You can invite friends or allow friends of friends to join,also allow the host of the party to kick out others that are In the party. Last but not least allow players to stream on the Nintendo switch.
PS4 can record 1hr of footage. #NintendoStillSucks
Worst console ever made
Only 30 seconds seriously
Alright, let's clear something up. yes, each video can only be 30 seconds long, but I do believe it resets each time you save a recording, meaning you just have to hit the button every 30 seconds or less. Then some really simple video editing and you've got a nice lengthy video.\n\nNow onto the main deal here. It's meant to catch amazing moments in games so you can share it on Facebook or Twitter. Look at this cool thing I did that I was luckily able to record after I did it! It's an amazing thing to have! So don't complain when they try to do things we want. We all know you are happy to be able to record no matter how limited.
Just press the button every 30 seconds easy in splat2 cuz of the timer
They should make it so you hold screenshot button to start, then click it again to stop. But you can only record 15 to 20 minutes!
I'm going to CAPTURE myself CAPTURING an enemy in Super Mario Odyssey!
If only we can adjust the time of video
Would be better if it was a half hour.
30 seconds? I'm gonna end up with a lot of wasted memo- wait you can change the length? Nevermind. Good job Nintendo. You are better than Microsoft because of the fact that you don't force us to make a 30 second recording when we only needed 3. Oh and also you make better games and DON'T sacrifice local multi-player for graphics. (looking at you halo 5).
I WAS WAITING FOR ThIS TO SHOW EVERYBODY MY SKILL ON SPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLAAAATOOOON\nAhem sorry x)
I’m looking forward to using this feature. Now I just have to think of something original.
Lets just hope the nintendo switch can be a success all its life, remember what happened to the dreamcast. Those days...
That’s awesome but still waiting for Nintendo to release an update where they ENABLE BLUETOOTH for audio devices. I want to use my Bluetooth headset on the go.
Nintendo, you guys are awesome! Thank you for adding this amazing feature!
So I still have to buy something to record my switch still? Well this sucks
Yes Nintendo, but what games am I gonna capture if there are no games to capture.
Well I came here thinking that they would allow you to capture long videos to post just for them to have you take them down.\nBut I guess a 30 second click posted to facebook or twitter isn't that bad... I mean unless they ask you to take those down too lol
And then have your capture immediately cease-and-desisted!
Can't upload videos on Youtube. :(
They shoul've been as long as probably 10 minutes or at least have better quality
How backlogged was this video?
Now NINTEND since your trying to be like everyone else why don't you try one more thing like everyone else and let us share with people on YouTube
Ah yes, lets give people the option to capture videos on our newest system!....except we won't let them upload it on video sharing sites!
Don't buy this rubbish👌
Wait, what? This doesn't work for ALL Switch games?! C'mon, Nintendo... :'(
It's a step in the right direction, but man they have a long way to go. I love shadowplay so much
I'm worried Nintendo is slowly turning into Microsoft
When I get a switch with splatoon 2 \n\nI’m gonna capture a video of the inkling creator
The switch is still relevant??
This is perfect!! Now if we could only post straight to instagram...

Yeah. Not going to waste my time.
Yeah, no Nintendo stuff allowed on Youtube, though. Big no no
Finally! It's only 30 seconds but at least we got something
Enough of the 2D boring pew pew games already! this is the future! where a massive open world like BOTW exists on SWITCH! Give me my Red Dead Redemption 2, My COD's and Battlefield's Nintendo! and I'll give you my mmmMONNEYYYYY.
You don't let anyone post so it's a useless function.
Why am I watching. I can't even afford a switch.
Find difference lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllLllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll if you find like please
Of course only 30 seconds. Don't want us making long video playthroughs. :/
how do we get this video's background music on the switch OS?
Almost as good as PS4's 60 minutes recording.\nAlmost.😝
Why only 30 seconds 😢
Nintendo never heard of the dark theme :(
Put Super Mario maker out for the switch 🙃🙃🙃
i could care less because it doesnt even post to youtube, but if they add a youtube option to editing and posting, that would be AWESOME.
I want the Nintendo switch!!! 😭
keep up the good work nintendo
Nintendo where is internet browser
I refuse to believe some of the people in the comment section are just that naïve. Its literally tells you its meant for highlights, people. Why am I seeing comments about capturing devices and streaming like it directly caters to and only to youtubers and so on, rather than someone out and about wanting capture a key moment on the go. I mean, as I recall, I do remember the Nintendo Switch being marketed as a device you can play and take anywhere, am I wrong?
why 30 second? 10-15 minutes is good but 30 second...
I thought it was gonna be like Playstation Screenshare. Oh well. :(
The reason that it's only 30 seconds long is because the feature is meant to capture game moments. Remember when Xbox introduced that feature by saying Xbox record that? Nintendo is basically doing the same thing. Ppl in the comments are saying they want full on YouTube video length recording features and that's not what Nintendo intended for the feature.
Im still waiting for super monkey ball 3 for the gamecube that was announced at E3 when the gamecube was out....smh im still waiting
See, now you just have to stop copyright striking us!
Who has a switch I do
ONLY 3 YEARS LATER, CAPTURE FEATURES AVAILABLE..... 30 seconds

This is just a test run on video capture for the Switch. It reminds me of the Share functionality on the PS4. I don't mind the short length of 30 seconds since Nintendo plans to extend it to around 5 minutes or more in the future.
they know they can't do a whole minute because the Nintendo switch has no space
And yet, you still can’t text these pictures and videos to people on your Switch friends list...
Still waiting for Nintendo Twitch

I still want pokémon icons on the switch.  Please Nintendo actually listen to a fan this time or I'll hack my switch to have them and find an exploit to get unbanned.
why 30 secs wtf nintendo :(
This is cool but to be honest it's useless nobodies going to use it for twitter or Facebook people only would want it for YouTube and if it was longer than 30 seconds
this does not work
It would be better to capture at least one hour to make gameplays
30 seconds wow Nintendo is that the best you could do.....you could do better
This is truly a fantastic feature!
TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT’S “ONLY THIRTY SECONDS”\nThis feature is meant for small clips or highlights of games. You should use this for when you do something cool that you wanna show your friends, like a triple kill in Spla2n or some really nice scenery in BoTW, and who knows they might increase it from 30 seconds to a couple of minutes. So just be patient, and be grateful with what you have now. (but lol i don’t think all the whiny kids don’t understand what “patience” or “gratefulness” is)
I DONT HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA!!!
Alright, let's clear something up. yes, each video can only be 30 seconds long, but I do believe it resets each time you save a recording, meaning you just have to hit the button every 30 seconds or less.

The second I read this title in my notification, I started to giggle.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I respectfully disagree with people about a cats  independence/pride not having value in a support class. Yes dogs builds can do many things for humans that cats builds will never be able to do but how much is that needed by the average human overall? Dogs unfortunately need a huge amount of  maintenance daily and otherwise.\n1 food\n2 grooming, \n3 walks\n4 training\n5  space\n6 healthcare\n7 entertainment  \n8 affection \n9 time \nall this can be quit daunting to a human who just needs a moral boost and/ or some cuddling but  not so much time to support a support class. this make the cat a great choice for many stressed overworked people.\ncats do need daily maintenance but compared to the dog there is no contest.\n\n1 food independence bonus!If outdoors cat build may find food and feed themselves \n2 grooming independence bonus self grooming! *not all build types apply recommend scratch post for nail care to nullify the home degrade from cat scratch.  \n3 walks  independence bonus self walking human not needed\n4 training independence penalty! you want me do what? f that I ain't your slave. independence bonus No potty training needed! If i hide my waste in this sandbox no one will ever  know  \n5 space 'independence bonus! yard not needed\n6 healthcare needs same support \n7entertaninmet needs same support\n8 affection needs same support\n9 time independence bonus flexible time needs! time reduction up to 50% or more!
Cats vs Dogs? You mean BB gun vs M16?
if toxiplasmosis is as strong as you say, why is it that you give all of the credit to the dog class and none to the cat class?\n\nI wonder if dogs have a hidden status effect that caused the imbalance in this video :thinking:
How would one go about a meerkat build?
You are a dog person eh?  Cats help with mice and vermin by removing them from the area (saving food stores), and provide a healing buff with a purr move.... this creates a regen that affects the cat and any creature in contact with it.  I hope you see this because the purr move is the only reason why I spec'd my noobs as cat builds.  Dog builds do not have any regen abilities... and they require more effort out of players that spec'd as human.
Can we get an arachnid video?
Can you do a video on the Kangaroo class? I feel like it’s a good class but I just don’t know how to use it well.
.. I love this so much....how did I never know these existed? And I'm sporting Cat x3 + Dog x1 +... wait do pet turkey's count? They're wild but I feed them occasionally...
Every person that wants him to be biased to cats: HE'S BIASED TOWARDS DOGS, CATS HAVE SAVED HUMANS FROM INTRUDERS IN 2 CASES IN HISTORY AND COMAS!!!!!I!I!III!!II
Does that make the cat a parasite?
How should I go about building my bacteria class?
Can you do a tier list on the ants. The one species that is everywhere you go no matter what
Since Halloween is coming up could you talk about the controversial Ghost builds?
Could you talk about the bear class?
I think this video is a tad bias,  but it's ok. Adblock😎
so... cats are too good at other things to be the true best support class.
I thought this was for real life, then I thought he was talking about a video game, then then I thought he was talking about real life in a video game... I’m so confuzzled
Why was the snake not listed in the human support tier list?  Are you saying snakes aren't real pets?  But IDC, it's still a great video!
Im glad such a unique underated channel is getting some spotlight and is tending.
Id like to know more about the leaf cutter or ant meta in general
A video about owl would help out my dumbass brother who only plays crazy offensive builds
Are you this old YouTuber called antvenom?
I'm a goat build, trying to go for that mountain goat doe, need to level up my legs and my hooves i think, can you help me? i don't really know.
When everyone gets salty because the cats aren't the strongest support class.
What the fuck is going on in this video?
What about the tier list for the North American server?
You need to remember pure support classes. Cats and dogs can both play independent of humans but what about classes that support the microbiome? Humans can survive without cats dogs and other macro-scale classes but micro-scale classes are inherently necessary to their continued dominance. Of course this also affects most other players in the entire game from micro to macro so if you're analyzing around the human perspective then perhaps it's not necessary to highlight, but it's important to remember that these classes form the backbone of any and all macro-scale strategies.
True pro humans have both cats and dogs as supports. Lots of maintenance, but the payoff is ridiculous.
Do a video on the Axolotl
I still like cats
Man, the salt from catfuckers is glorious. Can't even handle shitposting if it mentions the catshit from which toxo plasmosis is spread.
Talk to me when you make a dragon guide, smh to many plebs maxing fire breathe everyone knows you max wings then scales then fire
Great content! Support classes are among my favorites.\n\nCould you explore the current rodent meta?  There are a lot of interesting and diverse specialized builds, considering they almost uniformly revolve around the (probably OP) constantly growing incisors.  \n\nAlso, how are capybara players able to spec into such a unique ability as serenity aura?  They can befriend other players with startling ease.  Is there some wololo ayoyoyo at work, or is this just playstyle?  Inquiring minds want to know.
Hey, a friend of mine swears by the tarantula specs, but I'm not sure I'm sold on the arachnid guild or if I can get past how creepy it would look. Is a arachnid build really viable?
Now let's talk about the worst class\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman,i mean we smart but not smart enough to figure out that we should stop killing each other damn griefers(also human builds have a load of debuffs)
You should do one based on some of the stranger characters like say duck-billed platypus,  Narwals, Sea Pigs,  anything else thats just kinda bizarre
love the use of the dont starve sound track
Talk about the best survival builds
First time here and its great
So glad that your videos made it to trending so that other people can see your beautiful work, keep it going man 👍
The price hike for Daraprim was for insurance companies. People can get it for really cheap.
I'd like to see you cover the banning of the Dodo Bird, it's something I don't know much about and would love to hear your take on it.
What about ranged classes? \n\n\nEtc spitting cobras spray venom to their opponent causing victims health to keep draining until death unless the opponent is too big which is usually not the case because in the desert servers (which is where they live) the opponents are usually small enough for death usually that's their main attack but if that doesn't work they aren't afraid to bite you with the same effects \n\n\n\nElement venom \nIntelligence: 40\nStealth: 70\nDefence-low (but high for its size) so: 20\nSpeed- once again low (but high for its size): 30\nHP:20\n\nAnother ranged class is the Egyptian vulture.\nEgyptian vultures pick up rocks into the air using the move flight which utilizes the air element to lift it up in the air.After the vultures pick up the stones in the air they drop the stones on eggs (an earth element move) with tough shells killing their opponents before the baby stage reducing competition but the vultures had to develop high intelligence for that sometimes they just pick up the stone and start hammering at the egg without even flying into the air.\n\nSpeed:80\nStealth:80\nAttack:30\nDefence:25\nIntelligence:80\nHP:30
Can you mention Axolotl mains and give them a few pointers? I'm not one, but I was considering wiping my previous account as a fox to try something with better health retention.
Everyone’s joking about having real classes while I’m still sitting here scarred by the dogs and cats friggin murdering anything they see
This video is on trending! Well deserved, it will get more subs! I subbed when the channel had ~15k subs. 👌
What tier is best for jungle?
Cats are the embodiement of PvP players. Selfish as hell and cheat wherever they can. Dogs form thier APvP guild to contain the cats, then get baged by dog catchers. Wow games really do model real life sometimes.
I've been looking forward to your analysis of dogs since your first video
Talk about the platypus (also I think you could revisit this topic)
You should look into the balancing of different reproductive systems. Seems completely unbalanced that some classes have to camp their own spawn point to defend against griefers for months just because they have the egg skill tree when others get the incredibly easy budding ability.
Hey so are you ever gonna cover how massively unbalanced the Human players are? When are they gonna get nerfed? They are basically playing their own game at this point.
Will you make a video discussing the importance of the defensive meta and name some specific animals that follow this build?
So dogs are good for combo attacks and cats are the healers so cats are mercy(I think that's the healers name I don't know lol)and dogs are bastion,mcree and sometimes genji
This is why I don't raid with cats, Their toxoplasma parasite infects the group as well as the main boss which leads to unfair distribution of DKP. Always in their favor :(
Blue collar humans and White collar humans
What if the devs make a Mars expansion pack? Which tiers will do well on that map?
Since you did big cats can you do canines too? I know hyenas are more related to cats but could you add em in too if you do? Thanks LOVE YOUR VIDS
Mitochondria are the best support class. Nobody in there right mind would play without one on there team.
For the dog you forgot about recognizing invisible desieses and alerting their handler
I think it's time for a video on the number 1 undisputed SSS tier human, perhaps a  light recap of guild conflicts would be interesting (tier history series when??)
#17 Trending. Congrats for making it, and definitely lookong forawrd to what's next.
Dogs: Look at this team! We're gonna do great!\n\nCats; I need healing!
Cats have some of the best escape in the game in their climbing ability and acrobatic movement.\nBeing unable to reach the same levels of pure physical power doesn't matter because a cat can simply escape whenever its in a bad matchup, unlike a dog.
When you realize you're #20 on trending, wow great moves keep it up proud of you
i don't believe in the conspiracy, it might play a small part  but its probably cats because tribes helped them cause the kill mice that eat grain, so they were a support class but not any more.
Can you explain what the hell is going on with the great Potoo?
I’m a fox main and some of us in the community have managed to befriend humans
Nigga talking about it like life a game😂

I have a problem. I initially thought being a fish player was a good idea, but ultimately decided to make a switch. I want to make a switch to Megatherium, but my game always seems to crash when I try. I was wondering if you could make a video going over how to build with Sloths, or even how to build with the Megatherium (if my game stops crashing when I try to make one.) It would be incredibly helpful.
It's so obvious when someone is a dog main. :/\n\nCooking up conspiracy theories for why cats are such a high-ranked support class when even back in pre-release, cats remain THE most effective check for griefing mouse, rat, bird, mole, and even some lizard builds. Human players aren't really specced to handle those classes, never have been. For one thing, the larger build size of humans making it easy for smaller builds like the rodent class to easily evade them by retreating to terrain where bigger builds can't follow, allowing them to actually establish spawn points within a human player's territory and also sneak into human bases and steal valuable drops and resources directly from their storage containers. Plus, humans just dumped way too many stats into INT and its skill trees, and failed to go deep enough into the Perception skill tree to pick up on the heightened hearing, sense of smell, or even night vision perks that would help negate the lower tier classes' ability to grief them. Yeah, humans may dominate the current meta in terms of their influence on the meta itself, but the fact is that there will always be a thousand low-level players for every high-level one - and if the low-level players can grief the high-level players through sheer numbers, without being checked, that gradual erosion on the high tier player is going to start showing more and more of an effect.\n\nEnter, my friends, the cat class.\n\nThe cat class, as you noted, never made the switch from their assassin role to a support role. Why, then, are they considered a S tier support class? It's simple - the cat class never made the switch to a support role because it didn't need to. Its abilities as a stealth assassin class are exactly what human players needed, and so human players started pairing with cat players exactly as they were. The cat class comes STANDARD with all the abilities required to handle the numerous low-tier griefers that human players simply aren't equipped to, and any cat player playing solo will already BE tackling those griefers because it's the most logical, natural playstyle for anyone who specs into the class to begin with. What else are you going to do with all those stealth and attack points, especially at that build size? And then a human player comes along, sees what your class can do(that theirs can't, but desperately needs), and offers you a mutually beneficial arrangement where it shares its resources with you, in exchange for your doing exactly what you were already doing - just in their territory. Like I said, you can look back through past versions of the game all the way back to pre-1.0 and see this logic at work, with cat and human players teaming up as early as the Ancient Egyptian expansion.\n\nAnd all this is talking purely in terms of PVP game mechanics, and how the cat class helps shore up the human class' weakness to griefing. I'm not even getting into the fact that the cat class has aesthetic values of its own, or how they've invested points in the vocalization tree to communicate more effectively with human players - it's an essentially worthless perk when dealing with any other class, even other cat players - or their own INT stats that sometimes let them spec into other skills - even some normally associated with the dog class. I haven't even brought up the Purr perk, which - aside from being considered soothing by many players - actually comes with a small but not insignificant regen buff.\n\nSo who really needs to explain it as a conspiracy theory involving a cat-bacteria support relationship somehow manipulating human players, when there's such obvious logic to this team dynamic? It's blatant dog class bias. Especially when the article you cite shows that it's an estimate of BETWEEN 30-50% have been exposed to T. gondii, and MAY have been infected. So that's not a guarantee of how many human players have been infected, even the percentage of exposed human players could be as much as 20% lower as you state aloud(meaning you're skewing high on purpose), and - at MAXIMUM - you've only accounted for half of all human players. It also ignores the fact that for a human player to acquire the T. gondii debuff, they have to already HAVE exposure to the cat class. Isn't it logical to assume that the support pairing may have pre-dated the application of the debuff, then? After all, how would human players be getting the debuff if they had no reason to associate with the cat class to begin with?\n\nThis also ignores the statistics that - based on the statistics of US players alone - 36% of human players team up with dogs, and 30% of human players team up with cats. So for all those scare tactic statistics, human-cat support teams are LESS numerous than human-dog support teams! But I guess the popularity of the dog class is just because they're just that amazing, right? (And, to be fair - they are. No hate to any dog mains out there; I can't argue with the facts that dogs are practically OP as a support build. I'm just tired of people sleeping on the fact that the cat class have EARNED their place in S tier, as much as the dog class has...and it always seems to be dog class stans who act like the cat class cheated its way to the top.) And, of course, this is assuming that out of the MAYBE 50% of human players there are who have the T. gondii debuff, all 100% of human-cat support teams fall within that tentative 50%. That seems pretty statistically unlikely, doesn't it?\n\nIt's pretty telling that the same player who made the video about all the positive qualities of the feline builds somehow forgot all the virtues of those builds when talking about the feline build that ~happens~ to be in direct competition with another popular support build...I'm not saying the T. gondii debuff is completely insignificant, but when that's the only aspect of the build you focus on, it stops being a 'VS' video and becomes a fluff piece for your favorite class because there's no genuine comparison being made. :/ Disappointing.
Iguana is the true support meta. It's the only service animal issued to counteract the dreaded 'crippling depression' debuff.\n\nToxoplasma and enemy detection are no good if your human party leader went and ate the business end of a shotgun while you're stuck in the house.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I started as a human how do I restart?
First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\n\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\n\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\n\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.
that yellowstone reference killed me
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
not sure if this even gets to you with almost 4k comments, just wanne say good choice of music and really good video keep it up
But what about the cats that work for humans??  IE: ship cats that control rodent populations on ships. Or cats that control rodent populations in exchange for affection? Why would cats bring owners their food? Also, cats were originally a team style build (see: lions). They live in “colonies” that support each other much like wolf packs.
Please make a video on flies
What game is that?
Please talk about the MANTIS SHRIMP! It's claws move like a .22 caliber rifle and it can boil water just by moving.
how about a video on the viable bat builds
Dog maining elitist here forgot to mention how cat's make great defensive units when you're hoarding resources, and also boost immunity to certain diseases.  They have a strong morale boosting AOE, but the strength has a greater variability than the dog class.  Overall, their stats tend to vary more.  In some cases they can even exceed that of a dog.
Have you considered talking about  deep sea animals for Halloween?
See, cats purr. Can dogs purr? No. That is why cats are better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy cat hates me. I pet her too much
The cat and dog classes are pretty good with their own reasons but nothing can beat a falcon’s air strike. Air strike takes quite some leveling up to get but once you get it, it becomes overkill. I like to pair air strike with bird eyes for increased accuracy.
Many say the sea cucumber is man's best friend.
i want to play the horseshoe crab build, can you give me the low down on its viability?
Great video about supports for human players but would you mind going into more detail on legacy patches where humans weren't the only choice in the Homo genus?
do the best dog class
I'd love to see an analysis and guide for a primate build
How do you unlock the dog class
Please talk about the meta between rival ant teams?
Give us a dive gorilla build
I'm waiting for the sloth video, the most troll build in the game. Sloths offer great stealth and are so unattractive that very few other players even consider killing it. While the movement seems very basic there are a lot of aspects to master, today we see a lot of sloth players randomly dropping from trees and thus killing themselves. Definitely F tier but a highly interesting PvE build choice.
If it wasn't for cats, our ancestors would have all died of plague when humans began building cities. You know, because large stores of grain attract disease ridden rodents.
You say stole the top spot. I say Cats achieved the top spot. Survival of the fittest, b. Not a felines fault they managed to domesticated humans without having to learn stupid tricks. If dogs were smarter, they could have...lol. No, they couldn't.\n\nCats have always been, and will always be the supreme winners.
You think we could either get a human subclass tier list or a multipart bacterial one
Hey, um, microverse server player here (tuberculosis, yes I hated the antibiotics buff humans got), and I was wondering if the virus class is actually playable? I see them everywhere but they don't appear in the character creation menu. Are they even a playable class?
Dogs have an actual use cats just eat food and give no shits
500k or 1 mil why humans need a nerf.
What the music at 1:00 from?
I like how u ack like it is a game
i like the dont starve music
Everyone is talking about which class is better. Cat or dog? Welp, the answer is simple. If you get Positive support classes, you can have both. Not only do I reap the benefits of purr, I also get the protection of Bark.\n\nWhy choose one support style when you can have both!
What about parrot builds? I'm trying to figure out the pros and cons of all the builds and I need some help.
i wouldn't dream about EVER being forced to choose. I wouldn't tolerat it becuz its like choosing between ur children. They both thoroughly allow my heart all the magic it can hold...and MORE. Hellfire, I need some horses too, chickens maybe, throw in cpl turtles, i want a zoo. The more---the better. Life is all that better.
I would love to hear about mollusks in the meta. Specifically why gastropods like snails are so low on the tier list.
Dogs are much more work but a better support class
87 intelligence for dogs? ..... wow. I mean they are very lovable, but if you look at nature dogs really don't cut the mustard when it comes to intelligence. They are kind of not that high to be honest.
I like the don't starve soundtrack.
You forgot to mention many of cats unique abilities. Like being able to use way points and access to online maps to navigate back home no matter where a cat winds up. Or their passive ability that some spec into like ESP. Emotional sensor patrol.
Human and a whale shark build makes a overpowered aquarium,\n also do a build on alpacas.
Friendly reminder that users are stupid and will delete cat characters over the toxoplasmosis meme.\n\nPlease don't casually perpetuate it, dog mains.
I'm confused about my new build. I play a Cassowary, and I'm not sure how I should play.
Your channel is the first one I've ever supported on Patreon your content is amazing.
Can you talk about the parasite vs. commensal vs. support (mutualism) builds and which is best? Also a video about how cows are lowkey just giant exosymbiotic parasites of the bacteria living inside them would be awesome (only doing 20% of their own digestion, are you kidding me?).
The bird tier list. Make it happen.
I think an analysis of the megafauna trait would be fun and interesting
Please make a video about rat builds and their possibilities
Could you cover how humans have become more and more overpowered in recent patches?
just wondering, is there anything planned on ants?
Dog players actually have little to no control in how they want to spec, you are at the mercy of your human player.
Can we go over how the Human's two main passives, Craft and Augment, as well as its extremely high IQ stat have made it an undisputed top tier unit despite having mid to low HP, atk, def and stealth?
Nope cats are life cats help like u said but they also are the only self domesticated animal on the earth aka they CHOSE to stay with humans
Dog, if you want to care for a mammal that will love you in return for caring. Cat, if you're lonely and want a furry buddy nearby, and just want to set the food and water out.
Curious how Bear builds are doing in the meta. I’m considering maining one but I’m not sure what I want to spec
Can you give some advice on the platypus build?
The platypus is where it's at.
I was watching those videos for a month or so, and just now I understood the joke: tier means beast in German.
I would argue that in the current game meta, cats are the far superior support class. \nNot only do they grant the same initial buff that dog players do, but they also unlock the regeneration buff “Purr” \nIf you choose an inside or outside style cat player, you are also granted guarantees to a disease free guild hall caused by other low tier players such as rodents and birds. Much more effective in the most recent meta as the dog players “hunting” ability is much less needed with the current tech upgrades \nIt’s also interesting to note that while almost any cat class breed will grant the same buffs, not all dog class breeds will have the same effectiveness regarding the higher level buffs they have access to. \nCat classes also require much less player maintenance than dog classes, especially when choosing the outside cat class. \nAnother big thing to consider when looking at Support classes is the amount of time needed to reach specific buffs and the longevity of the support class chosen. While it can take years for dog classes to reach their max potential, cat classes main features are accessed within a few months. Dog classes also have an effective life span of 7-11 years of you choose the proper breed, while cats will remain good Support classes for up to 18 years or older. \n\nWhile the dog class has a lot of fancy buffs a human player can cultivate and gain access to, if you look at the time needed, the effectiveness in the current meta, the maintenance of he support class, and the life span of your companion, there really is no competition.
What purpose do hedgehogs have in their server?
Man I really wish they would turn tier zoo into a real game series.
Brb euthanising both my cats in favour of dog class.
I would like to see your tier placement of the Common Raven. Maybe along with the Elephant and Killer Whale as intelligent, social animals. I believe those three are top tier S class that inhabit Air, Land, and Sea.
What are your favorite builds?
Time to purge the cat class.
This is God damn genius!!!!!!!
Yeah, you have to train a dog for all those buffs. Doesn’t count
The music choices you used are amazing.
The runescape music in the beginning gave me nostalgia
D I S L I K E.
You should talk about the arthropod guild. the spider and insect classes have immense prevalence in the meta and ignoring them would be a mistake.
Would you ever think of splitting mobility into speed and dexterity?\nAlso, would someone care to explain the difference between defense and hp? I understand defense is kinda like armor but would there be a case of an animal with high hp and terrible defense or one with high defense and low hp?
Lmao teammates? You mean servants lol
Kodiak grizzly? Best 1v1?

To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
Please do a honey badger video they're such cute little deadly devils
Have you heard about the word?
Says dogs are the top of the meta\n\nGoes on to explain how cats are actually the top of the meta, while dogs are the strongest class.
I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.
WARNING⚠️\n\n\nIn the comments you will find:\n99% People writing essays about why cats are better that have also Never owned a dog \n1% this comment
Talk about bears and raccoons.  Please shit on how awful pandas are
Could you do one on eusocial insects? What tier are fire ants? I'm planning on playing as a fire ant colony for my next playthrough.
I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
What about the fast that cats help keep the rodent players from griefing human storages?
I feel so cheesy playing the Human class.
You mentioned Bat builds in your previous video but haven't actually gone in depth with them, I'm thinking on starting one up but want to know what I'm getting into first
Yup, cats are the haxorz. We pown your brain. But hey if it wasn't for stray cats we would be plauged by vermin.
that yellowstone reference killed me
I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
so glad you mentioned toxoplasma. will you cover more parasite builds?
Can you talk about the mantis shrimp class
Can you do a honeybadger build video. Good atk. Great defense. And even poison resistance feats.
What the “Maned Wolf” class. Are the long legs an ability or some kind of model glitch.
I love the DS music.
You just blew my mind.
But you forgot what happened on the MacQuire Island server. Cats were banned, and rats crashed the server (along with rabbits, but rabbits don't grief nearly as hard as rats). Seabird players at least at least had a fighting chance with cat players, but cats are a hard-counter against rats. And trust me, if any player can crash a server, it is rats.\n\nGranted, the concern was the feral cat subclass as opposed to the outdoor cat playthrough, but similar effects either way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gqOzTh2pjEw?t=12m27s
A look at where Bears and its sub-classes fit in the meta would be interesting.
My dog is ok but my cat is an asshole is this some kind of game
Man I know its hard work but I really wish you uploaded more, these are awesome.
You forgot to talk about the cats' primary support ability, their purr, which only support builds and a few offensive builds can spec into at all. It's one of the few abilities that provides a heal, and it's an AoE heal at that, on top of its other benefits. It's insanely broken.
Fable the lost chapters music?
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
Have you considered making a twitter and posting images of the tier lists you've done as well as maybe a sidebit or extra piece of analysis on a specific class that otherwise wouldn't make sense in a video?
PLAY OF THE GAME: Doggo as Dog: 76
Stop being a cheapskate and just buy the expansion so you can have two supp classes.
What makes the human build almost game breaking in the current meta
But what about the cats that work for humans??  IE: ship cats that control rodent populations on ships. Or cats that control rodent populations in exchange for affection? Why would cats bring owners their food? Also, cats were originally a team style build (see: lions). They live in “colonies” that support each other much like wolf packs.
Please make a video on flies
>Cat owners are infected with a mind virus\n>This is why my dog that eats its own shit, I have to walk every day and  barks at passing cars  at 4 am is superior
What game is that?
87 intelligence for dogs? ..... wow. I mean they are very lovable, but if you look at nature dogs really don't cut the mustard when it comes to intelligence. They are kind of not that high to be honest.

I'm confused about my new build. I play a Cassowary, and I'm not sure how I should play.
Can you talk about the parasite vs. commensal vs. support (mutualism) builds and which is best? Also a video about how cows are lowkey just giant exosymbiotic parasites of the bacteria living inside them would be awesome (only doing 20% of their own digestion, are you kidding me?).
How have I never seen this before! omfg literally, dictionary definition, of hilarious! I'm in an asylum now.

I love these videos so much!!! Thanks for making these!!
Its funny because Tier means animal in german.
I main oxpecker and my hippo is the best tank and support so kys I don't agree so I have the rights to destroy your self esteem. Also, can u do a video just talking about the Tier because sometimes I get confused
Lol the DST soundtrack made me think I had left the game on.
Do a Pangolin Build video
Can you explain why chickens are in D while pigs are in B? More people eat chicken across the world and chickens also provide eggs while pigs only provide their meat. Chickens also grow faster and are easier to take care of. Also, why are horses in B?
Can you talk about the viability of nudibranchs and other high-aesthetic builds?
I think it would be cool to see where ant colonies fit on this... would we play as an individual or the entire colony... same with bee and termite colonies
You can play almost any class as human-support.  I just came back from the snakes video, thinking what about pets?  I main Ball Python, my character is the most boopable snek in the world!~
I remember the days of when the horse was way too op. The human group called mongols destroyed other human players using horse players as supports. They were way too op.
I'm really curious about the Abyssal Plane servers and their meta. I've heard there is this weird class called a Blobfish.
While the available builds are yet to be optimized, if you create a Mineralia character, robot guild is looking like it'll be pretty good as far as support classes go.\n\nIncidentally, would you mind discussing the now-removed pterosaur guild, and what it brought to the table in terms of how to get a high-weight (and potentially high-power, see also the legendary Hatzegopteryx build) build while retaining and optimizing the flight ability?
We need capybara and the slime mold
You should have a video about which overpowered builds (for their niche) should be nerfed
Watching this as a have 1 cat laying on my legs and another sleeping around my neck/head, I feel like I might be a tad biased.
How about looking at the past meta at oceanic preds. How they rised & fell and if there might be hold outs still refusing to quit.\n\nAlso might be interesting if the devs might bring back some of these builds since there have been possible leaks of some subclasses returning to the current meta.
Explain the immortal jelly and how it has been breaking the meta for as long as it existed!
Could you do an analysis of the arachnid tier?
I need a build for a Hippo, and i'd also like to know the canine tier list to see if my fennec fox is meta right now.
I dont know how you only have so low subs. Your content is so well written and displayed! I literaly have shown your videos to everyone on my college so dont worry the word will spread quick!
Please do a honey badger video they're such cute little deadly devils
So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.\n\nDo you think this ability has any real use or effect in the current meta ?\n\nJan 27, 2003\nWhy do cats purr? - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/
This should *actually* be a real game.
I love your videos mate, keep it up !
I don’t understand why human mains even have support classes, I mean they are REALLY over powered. True human’s base and max strength is by no means the most threatening in the game but the devs gave human mains a way to high intelligence. Not only this but if humans speck even more into intelligence (especially with the “school” side quests) they can not only build homes that are practically impossible for any other players besides rat/mouse and insect mains to enter; plus the new Computer Buff they added just a little while ago human mains can practically watch the rest of us whenever they want. What I said here was barely even the tip of the ice berg, basically humans need a major debuff soon.\n- sincerely a sword fish main
I've noticed in my marine play throughs I've come across supportive microbial classes. I was just wondering at how available this class is to regular players since I've always started my upgrade tree past unicellular. I want to try and spec into algae, but I don't know where to start.
Aren't you concerned that the video might be taken down for the music?
Is the Mantis Shrimp an S tier class?
Have you heard about the word?
Says dogs are the top of the meta\n\nGoes on to explain how cats are actually the top of the meta, while dogs are the strongest class.
I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.
WARNING⚠️\n\n\nIn the comments you will find:\n99% People writing essays about why cats are better that have also Never owned a dog \n1% this comment
Talk about bears and raccoons.  Please shit on how awful pandas are
Could you do one on eusocial insects? What tier are fire ants? I'm planning on playing as a fire ant colony for my next playthrough.
I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Cats actually make pretty good support for humans. Throughout the game they've helped humans get rid of pest problems, such as mice and other rodents, who try to steal their food. And during Dark Age expansion, a lot of human players would have survived the bubonic plague if they didn't kill cats. See humans were affected by paranoia at the time and associated cats with the supernatural. They killed cats thinking it would prevent the sickness from spreading, when in actuality it did the opposite. If cats weren't hunted down at the time, they would have killed more rodents, the carriers of the plague, which would have lead to less human players getting wiped.
I need help. I started a party with both a Cat and Dog on my Human main thinking it would be new meta. But both players just cant work together which lead to me having to carry the team with no proper support. Your video made me consider ditching the Cat player but my character is already infected by the toxoplasma passive. What do I do?
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
so glad you mentioned toxoplasma. will you cover more parasite builds?
Can you talk about the mantis shrimp class
Dog playas represent.

Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
What about the fast that cats help keep the rodent players from griefing human storages?
I feel so cheesy playing the Human class.
You mentioned Bat builds in your previous video but haven't actually gone in depth with them, I'm thinking on starting one up but want to know what I'm getting into first
Yup, cats are the haxorz. We pown your brain. But hey if it wasn't for stray cats we would be plauged by vermin.

talk about the ocean sunfish build
Don't forget about cats' purr, which accelerates healing of themselves and those very near them
I'm not too much of the creative type but I would love to see a video done about chimps monkeys and other primates
Can you talk about the highest and lowest tier characters?
Ugh, that toxoplasmosis nonsense is ridiculously overplayed. And talk about bias, what about cats not being banned on Middle Eastern servers?
The Khajiit has wares if you have the coin
Great video, dude. I was curious about the best common support class for human players. I've seen some go with less-than-common supports that really don't seem like they actually fit as supports, but allow the human plays to absolutely excel in certain servers, primarily when they're under-equipped. You ever seen a human with the street vendor prestige with a panther or jaguar playing support? There's a very popular video showcasing one of these players with a fucking lion support in south africa. Try to gank that guy, I'd dare you!\n\nOne thing that's really strange to me is why anyone would actively play mosquito. They've got to be the lowest tier out of all the insect players, somewhere lower than E tier. Their natural predators don't even require them for their own playthroughs! The devs could totally wipe all mosquito players from the game, banning them permenantly, and the only class that would even notice would be the human players. That's a level beyond low tier if I've ever seen it. Even housefly players aren't that useless. What does a mosquito main even do all day? They have some of the shortest playthroughs I can even think of and are less effective at making an actual change in the meta than something like yersinia pestis players, who you'll remember damn near banned humans from the european continent earlier this season (of course that was with great help from rat players and there's a huge debate on whether or not it would've even been possible without the rat flea mains) \n\nAnyway I look forward to more of your analysis of the current meta. You're clearly quite familiar with a lot of the mechanics of the game.
There are couple builds that are suporisingly vital for the current meta:\nBees keep 85% of all servers flowers going,\nBats keep pest-insect -players at bay by harassing 99% of their builds &\nWhale-players' excerement keep certain CO2-eating -alagaes alive, thus indirectly keeping the new Climate Change-event at bay (well at least slows it). (Information from science-magazine Tieteen Kuvalehti) Then there are also vulture-players, that by devouring carcasses prevent some diseases from spreading to thr rest of the server.\n\nI'd be happy to hear about these true MVP-builds!\n\nThanks for stupid/smart/original content!
Do the human build,It’s what I main and I’m kind of just sitting in a Jai-I mean school,and Ist really boring.
The next patch, Tremors of Yellowstone looks to be a blast.
Dang RuneScape soundtrack in the beginning brings back so much memories
I kinda wish some company would actually make a game where you can actually play on the entire earth as different species like the stuff you do on your channel
Why are bees S tier?
if you want to choose a really good dog build, I suggest the Black Russian Terrier, they will work much more like a bear, they were trained initially to chase escaping prisoners from Gulags, they will present the strength and the likeliness of a bear, and still keep all  the strengths of a dog.
Do an insect tier list.
Cats are junglers or a damage support, while dogs are heavily reliant on their human carry to progress, while when multiple cat plahers have a lazy human player they can still strive and also cats scaling in the African servers are broken and dominate the meta
Ok so dogs _can_ be useful with specialty skill sets (even though they're usually only companions) however it's important to realize the overall cost to the human player. A dog is like having a perpetual child who is very needy, drawn toward self-destructive behaviors, and makes messes readily (often unintentionally griefing their own human companions.) Cats, however, are like college students. They aren't completely independent but if you make the correct resources available, they can usually make due on their own very well. They also cause little accidental griefing comparatively and do not have the aggression buffs of most dogs so they can more easily live side by side with other players in a human-led party who they might normally consider prey (like birds and fish.)
Bat class tier \nFor mammal players that want bird perks
what about the alleged healing properties of a cat's purr? That's a pretty useful support ability.
I love your videos. I have some questions:\nIs friendly fire cannibalism?\nIn Tier zoo, if it is possible, what are Prestige class? (class you can only unlock by upping a basic class like becoming palladin after warrior).

Hey,can you make a insects guide,the bee and mosquito/wasp are like the pistol srimph,all DPS but are kinda of a support too!look at the bee,it has a stinger and armor,looks like a great bruiser build,dosnt it??well,human player farm them for the honey consumable and the wax crafting material,and are one of the few classes that SINERGISES with plant kindom players,and look  at the mosquito,similar,and supports a DPS class:the Malaria build,giving them a GIGANTIC spd boost and the the ability to go though skin buff,giving the GIGANTIC DoT on human players is so fun!make a guide on them,NOW!!
What you say about Cats is true, but imprecise. Remember back in the Bronze Age days when Mice and other species griefed Humans' crops? Before Human players realised they were the absolute top-tier class? I remember when Cats in most Egypt servers were extremely popular, employed to hunt vermin and protect the crops, so much so that it became a meme religion akin to twitch's Helix Fossil; then again, a good 90% of Egypt servers' religion was based on class memes, and you could even argue that it was born out of Toxoplasma Gondiis' trolling.\n\nAfter BA was over, Cat memes got old and were particularly hated in Europe servers during Medieval Age. Black Cats were particularly hated, and most of the time their Human supportees were unreasonably hunted down simply for collaborating even once. I mean, I know those memes were bad, I still remember them, but why kill other Human players over them, even the newbies?\n\nThen that became a meme and luckly unfunny class memes came to a stop, for a while at least.\n\nNowadays Cat supports aren't used anymore in crop farming (AKA farm farming) because we have better Farmer weapons and skills for Humans in 1stWC servers along with P2W consumables to protect the crops, but if it wasn't for TPG existing and Cats lacking CC, they would be the absolute top-tier support/hunter hybrid class.\n\nI'm a Chow Chow support Dog main btw. Sorry if this comment sounded biased.
You're growing so fast, when you grow even more hopefully some game company will help you actually make the game. Would be awesome

Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
Heeey... song name?
Bear Tier
Honey badgers!
Dog playas represent.
So basically cats are useless
YELLOWSTONE SUPERVOLCANO BALANCE PATCH\nBACK UP ALL FILES
Thorny dragon
HORSESHOE CRABS
Do a bacteria tierlist
Question: are penguins trolling?
Mosquitoes
Wtf did i just find
This channel is done incredibly well, fantastic job! Easily one of my top 3 channels. I'm stoked about upcoming content.\n\nIf we are allowed to make request, I'd love to see birds of prey. Recently did a falconry tour and it was one of the most amazing experiences I've had.
Scum scum get cancer and die black woman. Lol lol
Feel bad for the airline having to deal with entitled crap like this.
They continue to fight whites/flags/statues while MY PEOPLE die DAILY in the STREETS.  Pink elephant.
There are a lot of hateful bastards commenting here,  what a shame!!!
lol, what can i say ?
Wait so you are Executive Platinum or Platinum Pro?  If not then that's why she laughed when you said you are a platinum member.  Were you flying less than 500 miles? If you went over 500 miles you would need to pay for an upgrade as a regular Platinum member.
NOBODY CARES HERE IN THE NICE COMMUNITY
She just can't stay out of trouble.  Then blames white men, of course.  What a racist.
Sue these motherfuckers.
LOL at white male aggression.  How racist.  Can you imagine if that was said about a person of color?  I want to see VIDEO of the encounter.  From the ticket agent to the pilot.  I dont believe people.
Have you tried not being a cunt and see how that works out for you?
Hello Dear   I do not work AA, I work for one of the major carriers. Yes, platinum  members are entitled  to perks like upgrading. But if someone wants to pay for that seat , they have priority.  , upgrades are given out minutes before boarding . In your case if the system gave you that seat and allowed you to book it, it should have been yours. It was an error. In there part and you should have been compensated.   So
This woman is a race baiter if there ever is one.  They kicked her ass off the flight because the Pilot saw her as being a erratic fucking idiot that may be a problem.  He has that right, he doesn't have to explain himself to anyone.  He's the fucking Pilot.
I'm sure she was peaceful and polite, lol yeah right...
She is just a disenfrenchfries black woman whos showance collapse LOL
Have you tried not being a cunt and see how that works out for you?
It's called propagation.  There's other words for it. It's the time it takes for one server to update to other servers and databases.  An example is when you draw money from your bank, get home and check your account, but the withdrawal isn't there yet because your bank has a server that updates every hour or 2 hours..most should be every 5 or 10 min or instantaneously, but it is what it is. For the airline to have a kiosk that lets you edit your seating, prints you your updated ticket and then prints out a ticket  at the gate that doesn't reflect that change means they have a sorry update system.  As far as her response, I'm sure she regrets it, but something about airline travel makes people get overly emotional(this goes for airline staff as well)

crystal is defiantly a lesbian
Crystal was the only one who actually tryed not to break the law lmfao.
Pretty sure traffic accidents aren't illegal
Crystal is having that patience that i’m looking for in a girl ;D that’s like +3 out of the fictional “10”
It was not that hard but, probably for entertainment.
Did you steal this video as well?
Crystal won the best citizen award.
Black guy lost of course
Garrick broke a law for his Taxi crashing?
I wrote a blog post a while ago about why I fucking hate video games. Because this is what it does, it like appeals to the male fantasy.
What happened to gta being the worst game ever
Sydnee is such a moron she is a down
@ 4:00 is that the background music from Funhaus videos?
So they learnt nothing and still into violence. Pretty good game i would say.
Are they even trying?
Play Mario without breaking any laws
the brunette is fine as hell
I don't know what he called me, he said somthing 😂
Lol on trending page this has 666k views
The black guy done the most crimes\n\n\n\n\n\nWow
Of course the black guy committed the most crimes
dam sydnee is so beautiful future wife
There is a mod that forces you to obey traffic laws by spawning police cars into traffic and fining red lights, speeding, any kind of accident and in general any misbehaviour. Combined with the mod that enables using steering wheels  you get a pretty near realistic driving experience.
This is a very timely video, coincides with the game's release 4 years ago.
This wasn't trying at all
Not sure if Crystal is 42 or 24
Some of these shouldn't have even been counted, like when the car crashed into him and the taxi hitting someone, he doesn't control the AI, so why did he get penalized?
5:54 is me whenever I try to do anything. 😹
Am I the only person that enjoys obeying the traffic laws in GTA?? 😂😂😂😂
Nice try but not so good
Wow, nobody has ever done this before! Great, original content Buzzfeed!\n\n\nFucking cacks.
making my way down town walking fast faces past and im homebound dodoododoodododo (hits person with car) um sorry i was listenng to mah music
I play like this on a daily basis.
Admit it we all did this when we got bored
I could probably do that. It would be difficult, but not impossible.
crystal could totally be a model. cute face n eyes.
How da f hasn't done this?!?
That’s how my sister plays lol
I know this idea has been done so many times before. But I still find it funny every time people do it 😂
Of course Buzzfeed makes a video about not breaking any laws when they support Antifa and all they do is break the law.
I did this all the time in midnight club
Crystal was the only one atleast trying
Its not that hard to obey the law in this game. There is definitely a reason these people are being complete and utter idiots.
I usually play gta without breaking the laws cause its fun
Wonder how much crap they would get if they had all colored people playing lmao
Lol a black man trying to not break a law.
Your black you already broke Lifes biggest law
Crystal is too good for this earth
You didn’t obey the law actually
Get the peeps from the rp servers over to buzzfeed
drive safely and don't kill ppl
mom, how many times have I told you that you can choose what you want to do!
Honestly it's 1 of my dreams for an open world game like GTA to be alot more realistic like following traffic laws & such yet it's still like a crime game of course lol the more realistic & immersive the better! Tho I do think it should be a separate difficulty like just making the entire game life like realistic aka a true realistic difficulty!
This is why I hate video games, because they appeal to the male audience🙄
“Somebody, I know somebody did this in the video, don’t.. don’t do the stars”
when you saw the score at 3:27 what should you think about at the fist?
So she played the game, but doesn't even know that the white car is franklin's car? 🤔
WHAT IS THIS VIDEO TRYNA SAY HUH, BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE MOST VIOLENT!!!????? jk
They're hella doing this on purpose
Admit it u have tried it.
I wrote a blog post a while ago about why I fucking hate video games, because this is what it does! It appeals to the male fantasy!
It's not his fault if his taxi crashed dip shits
For some reason I thought they meant not breaking irl laws while playing gta
You broke the law  Much in gta that even of you walk, your just breaking the law
Oh and of course buzzfeed the black guy gets all the crimes
Why did you guys give Garrick a strike for the  taxi driver breaking the law
should be watch a movie right....?
See? The black man committed the most crimes.\n\nJk it was probably just a coincidence
We tried playing Grand Theft Auto 5 without the male fantasy.
WHY CAN'T YOU USE TURN SIGNALS?!?
The Black guy break the most rules . What a surprise
is that even possible?

Dude let it go... It died faster than a guy with malaria,  AIDS,  and terminal cancer.
If only this game wasn’t a ghost type now
I SAW SABLEEYE THE OTHER DAY!
Have you not caused enough damaged a silly white kid jumped over the white house gate to catch a Charizard. Stop it we obviously can't catch them all! Also mind where you place Pokemons like the white house, North Korea, volcanoes, and Kim Kardashians butt. Places like that. Stay awesome Pikachu.

Local trainer battles,  wild pokemon battles, exp/lvling through these means, and trading.\n\nThis is what you need to get back the kinds of numbers you were pulling when this first came out.\n\nI mean unless you guys hate money or something. Idk if that's your thing.

If you are playing Pokémon go you're a Russian agent :)
It's so beautiful that Lavander  Town music is played at  night time in  the game.
Quote from Pokemongolive (official site): You’ll also earn extra Candy while you’re out trick-or-treating with your Buddy Pokémon: Candy rewards from catching, hatching, and transferring Pokémon will be doubled, and your buddy will find Candy twice as fast during the Halloween celebration! \nthis isn't true. walking with your buddy still only gives 1 candy
I’ve caught all of them :D

Gen 3 is the best gen!
Does anyone still play this
My unpopular opinion: gen 3 is overrated, gen 4 is underrated. Please respect opinions, even if you don't agree with them
A feeble attempt of making the game popular which will only last for about 3 weeks before it dies once again.
And here's your 3rd update for the entire year!
I caught the Halloween pickachu today. Made my day. and I didn't even have to go outside I just turned on the app and I also caught some of the other Halloween pokemon as well I believe i'm only missing one.

This makes my gamer heart happy
Stfu hes a dankey kang playa thats how he gor it or should i say his mother gave him dat name and he grew his own mustache
Shigeru needs to learn English.\n\nNot saying he's bad
Not exactly accurate (as its ignoring mr. Game And Watch) but great vid!
What's the background song?
why tf were you using a kart in mariokart wii when bikes where the superior race in that game
How Mario got a moustache:\n\n\n\n\n\nHe grew it.
Can someone tell me the theme in the background?
Answer: he grew it
0:18 Actually I do. Trust me, I'm a pretty big Mario fan.
Shigeru Miyamoto is a living legend, with so many amazing titles like Mario and Zelda under his belt. He should be considered a national treasure man!
mario is't a plumer anymore stay up to date\nalso when you said you never knew this.i knew it all you cant read my mind sorry ;)
I learned all this stuff a year ago I even read a book on Nintendo
Nintendo was founded in 1889. Did anyone fact check this video.
My mom played Super Mario on the NES when she was little!
I guess the whole land lord thing inspired hotel mario
its not 1886 its 1889 do your research
Time to waste $60 next week (for good purposes)
Was I the only one who was kinda disgusted when she said peach princess?
The video is pretty fitting, considering Mario Odyssey comes out in a week. It's hype!
Fun Fact: one of Mario's original names were middle-aged guy
Peach Princess\nThis video instantly lost all credibility.
Jump man Jump man Jump man that boy up to somethin
Im pretty sure we all know he got his name from Mario Segali
The first thing you don't know: Princess peach is the peach princess.
That's not mario, thats FLINSTONES.
0:11 YOU HAD ONE JOB!
uh you werent exact it was 1889 not 1886
I thought he got the name and mustache because *_He’s a god damn italian_*
Why didn't you show Mario 2 or 3 when you put the cartridge in? The best ones!
1889 actually, get your History right, great big story
Remember when Mario was Still  Plumber. Good Times.
THE LEGEND HAS SPOKEN!!
When mario breaks up with peach\nMario:were breaking up\nPeach: way?!\nMario:its not you it's a me mario
it is not a mustache it's a dirty sanchez
bro I been knew all this shit
so the lack of art skill to draw hair is what cause mario to wear a hat lol
5:53 IS THAT GENIUS ADVERTISING OR IS IT A RANDOM NAME?
I actually played sonic the hedgehog as a child
Luigi god his name from GASP LEO LAIGI LUIGI
Lueeeeegeeeee, you gotta go save the *Peach Princess*
Oh, I know mario cuz matpat told me so if you wanna know who mario really is, go watch his videos at his channel game theorist
One of the first
IT'S A ME- A-MARIO
What's the intro song? That's fire
I've played Mario karts However as an Italian I've always found it very disturbing
Don't like my comment
Wish I can meet this man
Can you please do one about The legend of Zelda like how Link got his name or something.
I love Miyamoto cuddling with his Mario plush!!\nAhhh! My heart!\nIt's so cute, Mario is his child, he's so proud of what Mario is and has become. \nIt must be such a powerful and pure feeling. :')
Saving the Peach Princess\noh my god
Sad Luigi... Never getting the credit he deserves...
They. Got. The. Inventor. Of. SUPER MARIO!?!?!?!?
Shigeru Miyamoto should win a Nobel Prize
I love how Miyamoto pronounces Luigi as WEEGEE <3 YES! The meme lives!
why do you have to get sponsored by cnn
Trending omg I’m so proud of this channel \nLike if u agree
*oh boy this make me so happy*
The p e a c h p r I n c e s s
i already know this...
4:45 Miyamoto is sitting like a princess xD
Get me someone that looks at me the way Shigeru Miyamoto looks at that Mario plush 5:42 and I'll be happy for the rest of my life.
Mario odyssey in *ONE WEEK!!!*
see the ting is apparently marios not a plumber now according to nintendo :/
you forgot mario is not a plumber anymore
You guys should do something on Polybius... I'd 100% watch that
WHAT ABOUT WEEGEE HE IS A LEGEND. right?
Wait, wasn't the original Donkey Kong arcade game going to be a Popeye game?
Miyamoto is a legend.
And now, why's Luigi green? Why not other color like blue or yellow?\nIs that because green is complimentary color to red...?
Wait, I thought everyone knew this
The peach princess... do some more research
*sAvInG ThE pEaCh PrInCesS*

As somebody who grew up getting a new Mario game every Christmas, this video gave me great joy. All the memories and cold winter's spent on my consoles with endless hours of joy ;)
I also knew nintendo was founded in the 19th century and made playing cards cuz it was on a snapple bottlecap
I like how she tells us how we don’t know everything about our favorite plumber, yet she called peach the “peach princess”
Saving the peach princess \nShe said that all wrong its saving princess peach
And o thought princess pech was a parody character
Is it mustache or moustache?now I'm confused
how mario got is mustache! ... he's Italian ... duh... why is this a video?
Peach princess,there are literally 2 words that have to be in order and you managed to screw it up

They put in cartridges for super mario bros 1 2 and 3, mut the footage for all of them is just super mario bros 1. One of them has a vector filter on to smooth it out. Why?
This makes my gamer heart happy
What was 0:01 song name?
What's the music they used in the beginning
Stfu hes a dankey kang playa thats how he gor it or should i say his mother gave him dat name and he grew his own mustache
Next. Kirby the pink glutinous rice ball. The laziest character design in the world lol.
God, Mario is my childhood he was my idol, my hero, and he still is today. Thx for the memories nintendo!
Shigeru needs to learn English.\n\nNot saying he's bad
Not exactly accurate (as its ignoring mr. Game And Watch) but great vid!
What's the background song?
why tf were you using a kart in mariokart wii when bikes where the superior race in that game
How Mario got a moustache:\n\n\n\n\n\nHe grew it.
Can someone tell me the theme in the background?
Answer: he grew it
0:18 Actually I do. Trust me, I'm a pretty big Mario fan.
Shigeru Miyamoto is a living legend, with so many amazing titles like Mario and Zelda under his belt. He should be considered a national treasure man!
mario is't a plumer anymore stay up to date\nalso when you said you never knew this.i knew it all you cant read my mind sorry ;)
I learned all this stuff a year ago I even read a book on Nintendo
Nintendo was founded in 1889. Did anyone fact check this video.
My mom played Super Mario on the NES when she was little!
I guess the whole land lord thing inspired hotel mario
*PEACH PRINCESS*  And they say the fake gamer girl is a myth...
its not 1886 its 1889 do your research
Time to waste $60 next week (for good purposes)
Was I the only one who was kinda disgusted when she said peach princess?
The video is pretty fitting, considering Mario Odyssey comes out in a week. It's hype!
Fun Fact: one of Mario's original names were middle-aged guy
Peach Princess\nThis video instantly lost all credibility.
Jump man Jump man Jump man that boy up to somethin
Im pretty sure we all know he got his name from Mario Segali
The first thing you don't know: Princess peach is the peach princess.
That's not mario, thats FLINSTONES.
0:11 YOU HAD ONE JOB!
uh you werent exact it was 1889 not 1886
I thought he got the name and mustache because *_He’s a god damn italian_*
Why didn't you show Mario 2 or 3 when you put the cartridge in? The best ones!
1889 actually, get your History right, great big story
Remember when Mario was Still  Plumber. Good Times.
THE LEGEND HAS SPOKEN!!
When mario breaks up with peach\nMario:were breaking up\nPeach: way?!\nMario:its not you it's a me mario
it is not a mustache it's a dirty sanchez
bro I been knew all this shit
so the lack of art skill to draw hair is what cause mario to wear a hat lol
5:53 IS THAT GENIUS ADVERTISING OR IS IT A RANDOM NAME?
I actually played sonic the hedgehog as a child
Luigi god his name from GASP LEO LAIGI LUIGI
Lueeeeegeeeee, you gotta go save the *Peach Princess*
Oh, I know mario cuz matpat told me so if you wanna know who mario really is, go watch his videos at his channel game theorist
One of the first
IT'S A ME- A-MARIO
What's the intro song? That's fire
I've played Mario karts However as an Italian I've always found it very disturbing
Don't like my comment
I love how Miyamoto pronounces Luigi as WEEGEE <3 YES! The meme lives!
why do you have to get sponsored by cnn
Trending omg I’m so proud of this channel \nLike if u agree
*oh boy this make me so happy*
Super nintendo dirty as hell
Name of song?
Yawnssss... Old news.
*sAvInG ThE pEaCh PrInCesS*

0:20 *your favorite not-so-plumber anymore italian.
Yea I already know this....
Whoa...
0:19\nMy favourite is luigi
I can trick you\n\n\n\nRead more
I never liked Mario games and I don't understand the extreme overhype around these silly games series.
Almost as good as PS4's 60 minutes recording.\nAlmost.😝
30 seconds? I'm gonna end up with a lot of wasted memo- wait you can change the length? Nevermind. Good job Nintendo. You are better than Microsoft because of the fact that you don't force us to make a 30 second recording when we only needed 3. Oh and also you make better games and DON'T sacrifice local multi-player for graphics. (looking at you halo 5).
I WAS WAITING FOR ThIS TO SHOW EVERYBODY MY SKILL ON SPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLAAAATOOOON\nAhem sorry x)
I’m looking forward to using this feature. Now I just have to think of something original.
Lets just hope the nintendo switch can be a success all its life, remember what happened to the dreamcast. Those days...
That’s awesome but still waiting for Nintendo to release an update where they ENABLE BLUETOOTH for audio devices. I want to use my Bluetooth headset on the go.
Nintendo, you guys are awesome! Thank you for adding this amazing feature!
So I still have to buy something to record my switch still? Well this sucks
Well I came here thinking that they would allow you to capture long videos to post just for them to have you take them down.\nBut I guess a 30 second click posted to facebook or twitter isn't that bad... I mean unless they ask you to take those down too lol
And then have your capture immediately cease-and-desisted!
Can't upload videos on Youtube. :(
Add the virtual console ALREADY!!!
They shoul've been as long as probably 10 minutes or at least have better quality
How backlogged was this video?
Now NINTEND since your trying to be like everyone else why don't you try one more thing like everyone else and let us share with people on YouTube
Ah yes, lets give people the option to capture videos on our newest system!....except we won't let them upload it on video sharing sites!
Don't buy this rubbish👌
Wait, what? This doesn't work for ALL Switch games?! C'mon, Nintendo... :'(
It's a step in the right direction, but man they have a long way to go. I love shadowplay so much
I'm worried Nintendo is slowly turning into Microsoft
When I get a switch with splatoon 2 \n\nI’m gonna capture a video of the inkling creator
The switch is still relevant??
This is perfect!! Now if we could only post straight to instagram...
This is just a test run on video capture for the Switch. It reminds me of the Share functionality on the PS4. I don't mind the short length of 30 seconds since Nintendo plans to extend it to around 5 minutes or more in the future.
they know they can't do a whole minute because the Nintendo switch has no space
And yet, you still can’t text these pictures and videos to people on your Switch friends list...
30 seconds doesn´t seems like much, but if this gets popular enough, they´ll surely improove it.\nI mean... they found a way to record video with the 3DS so... everything is possible!
So uhhh why’s this in trending
Can you get the game planet caserster
Welp, I finished zelda and now you add this??
I think they should create Nintendo Drive app for any device. I'm sure there is a way to share on other social media sites. Like with Xbox & PlayStation. 😊
Gimme a Nintendo switch or i’ll swear on a Christian Minecraft server
Does Nintendo have something against Google and YouTube?
Great addition, Nintendo! The game recording could be a bit smoother.... but I've just tested it while undocked. But definitely want smoother videos (if possible)
this idea would have been WAAAY better if you could record for at least 30 minutes
This would be cooler if you could hit the capture button and it recorded the last 30 secs you just played, instead of recording for 30 secs after you push the button. The weirdest things happen in games when you least expect it.
I want The nintendo Switch
full of surprises not really, you guys mentioned this when you aired the console.. also.. make the video capture better 30 seconds is not enough for anyone xD
About time, so where's the Virtual Console, huh Nintendo?
This is Not Video Capture is Social Capture But Can You Make anither Video Capture Where we can Stop Recording at Any time and Don't Have to Hold the Capture Button and Like Make a Record In Settings or Stream In Settings,Please! I really want To record For Any Minutes
So its the same as xbox game dvr
This is awesome and I actually have an Elgato. Much more convenient than that of the PS4 and Xbox One. For those that think little of this, the Xbox One just recently went from a 5-minute limit to 30. I believe the PS4 is still 15 minutes. Keep in mind that both of these consoles can barely fit in a backpack while most of the memory is taken up by game installs. A single button press.
Why is only compatible with 4 games? Is that Nintendo’s way of testing and rolling out the new features?
If video can upload to youtube i think will better
Is this gonna be like smash bros, where the clips delete after each patch?
Cant we just be exited for a feature? I mean, Xbox has it, and you'll probably be able to Stream to Twitch in online 2018
I gave a thumbs up, Subscribed and Hit the bell, thanks!
yes, although it's disappointing it's only 30 seconds
I just go the update and I was excited but as soon as it was done my left joy con wouldn’t connect in tv or table top mode\n\nEdit: i even realized that I have to update my joycon and it still didn’t work
this seems pretty cool, but please nintendo. can you raise the video time at LEAST 30 more seconds?
i could care less because it doesnt even post to youtube, but if they add a youtube option to editing and posting, that would be AWESOME.
Hi can you send me one for FREEEEEEE
Why did you ban 8BitDo controllers Nintendo stop being so greedy!
Can you also record Mario + Rabbits Kindom Battle?????
Please Netflix!🤗

30 sec? i better using my phone to record that
why 30 secs wtf nintendo :(
Why just 30 seconds?
You have to pay for multiplayer ewww...  pass.
Since you can't upload to gameplay to Youtube then why are you showing us this on YouTube? Nintendo is such a hypocrite
Does this mean you wont take peoples money from posting gameplay videos or nah
30 second isn’t that bad, it’s like in Xbox when you do a moment in the last 30 seconds you can record it and your friends can see it. 30 seconds is pretty long actually. Hopefully Nintendo do something along the lines of posting it to your Nintendo account or something and can see it on your phone.
So Nintendo let's you record gameplay with the switch but if you post it to youtube they take all the revenue?  Nice.
Cool can I have normal voice chat now?
A few nitpicks:\n- 30 seconds is too short\n- YouTube should definitely be an option\n- Why 480p?\n- You should be able to record AFTER you press the button (maybe press the capture button & the d-pad at the same time?)\nI'm grateful for this feature, but it can definitely be improved on in the future
Capture a Nintendo video, post it to YouTube. Nintendo flags it, it's copyright material.\nWell lookit me. I'm a big dumb sucker! HA
30 seconds whoopee doo
this does not work
It would be better to capture at least one hour to make gameplays
30 seconds wow Nintendo is that the best you could do.....you could do better
Well lets all hope that Miiverse will come to the switch.
Dear Nintendo.I got some great ideas for the Nintendo switch updates!!!Can you guys please add a built in mic in the switch or allow any gaming headset to the switch instead of the awkward phone cables chat thing. voice chat would be easier. Also take off friend codes!it's annoying typing in codes just to get a friend. Also please don't make us pay to play online. And maybe add parties to the switch. parties are group of friends that can chat together. You can invite friends or allow friends of friends to join,also allow the host of the party to kick out others that are In the party. Last but not least allow players to stream on the Nintendo switch.
PS4 can record 1hr of footage. #NintendoStillSucks
Worst console ever made
Only 30 seconds seriously
Alright, let's clear something up. yes, each video can only be 30 seconds long, but I do believe it resets each time you save a recording, meaning you just have to hit the button every 30 seconds or less. Then some really simple video editing and you've got a nice lengthy video.\n\nNow onto the main deal here. It's meant to catch amazing moments in games so you can share it on Facebook or Twitter. Look at this cool thing I did that I was luckily able to record after I did it! It's an amazing thing to have! So don't complain when they try to do things we want. We all know you are happy to be able to record no matter how limited.
Just press the button every 30 seconds easy in splat2 cuz of the timer
They should make it so you hold screenshot button to start, then click it again to stop. But you can only record 15 to 20 minutes!
I'm going to CAPTURE myself CAPTURING an enemy in Super Mario Odyssey!
If only we can adjust the time of video
Would be better if it was a half hour.
30 seconds? I'm gonna end up with a lot of wasted memo- wait you can change the length? Nevermind. Good job Nintendo. You are better than Microsoft because of the fact that you don't force us to make a 30 second recording when we only needed 3.

Enough of the 2D boring pew pew games already! this is the future! where a massive open world like BOTW exists on SWITCH! Give me my Red Dead Redemption 2, My COD's and Battlefield's Nintendo! and I'll give you my mmmMONNEYYYYY.
You don't let anyone post so it's a useless function.
Why am I watching. I can't even afford a switch.

Of course only 30 seconds. Don't want us making long video playthroughs. :/
how do we get this video's background music on the switch OS?
Almost as good as PS4's 60 minutes recording.\nAlmost.😝
Why only 30 seconds 😢
Nintendo never heard of the dark theme :(
Put Super Mario maker out for the switch 🙃🙃🙃
i could care less because it doesnt even post to youtube, but if they add a youtube option to editing and posting, that would be AWESOME.
I want the Nintendo switch!!! 😭
keep up the good work nintendo
Nintendo where is internet browser
I refuse to believe some of the people in the comment section are just that naïve. Its literally tells you its meant for highlights, people. Why am I seeing comments about capturing devices and streaming like it directly caters to and only to youtubers and so on, rather than someone out and about wanting capture a key moment on the go. I mean, as I recall, I do remember the Nintendo Switch being marketed as a device you can play and take anywhere, am I wrong?
why 30 second? 10-15 minutes is good but 30 second...
I thought it was gonna be like Playstation Screenshare. Oh well. :(
The reason that it's only 30 seconds long is because the feature is meant to capture game moments. Remember when Xbox introduced that feature by saying Xbox record that? Nintendo is basically doing the same thing. Ppl in the comments are saying they want full on YouTube video length recording features and that's not what Nintendo intended for the feature.
Im still waiting for super monkey ball 3 for the gamecube that was announced at E3 when the gamecube was out....smh im still waiting

I still want pokémon icons on the switch.  Please Nintendo actually listen to a fan this time or I'll hack my switch to have them and find an exploit to get unbanned.
why 30 secs wtf nintendo :(
This is cool but to be honest it's useless nobodies going to use it for twitter or Facebook people only would want it for YouTube and if it was longer than 30 seconds
this does not work
It would be better to capture at least one hour to make gameplays
30 seconds wow Nintendo is that the best you could do.....you could do better
This is truly a fantastic feature!
TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT’S “ONLY THIRTY SECONDS”\nThis feature is meant for small clips or highlights of games. You should use this for when you do something cool that you wanna show your friends, like a triple kill in Spla2n or some really nice scenery in BoTW, and who knows they might increase it from 30 seconds to a couple of minutes. So just be patient, and be grateful with what you have now. (but lol i don’t think all the whiny kids don’t understand what “patience” or “gratefulness” is)
I DONT HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA!!!
Alright, let's clear something up. yes, each video can only be 30 seconds long, but I do believe it resets each time you save a recording, meaning you just have to hit the button every 30 seconds or less.

Put Super Mario maker out for the switch 🙃🙃🙃
cant wait for chrismas
trim for gifs lol
Yaaaas
I want the Nintendo switch!!! 😭
Why only 30 seconds 😢
_Oh?_
Finally
Epikooo!!!!!1111
30s? Pointless Nintendo move right there.
30sec capture and #30 on Trending
Please Netflix!🤗
NEW TECH!!! https://youtu.be/ctFg0XC9_8Y
I still want achivements.
Welcome to 2017
Nintendo Mexico please
Cool!
No YouTube?.....
Still waiting for Nintendo Twitch
Awesome !
Finally
...but what about streaming/posting gameplay videos on YouTube?
30 second isn’t that bad, it’s like in Xbox when you do a moment in the last 30 seconds you can record it and your friends can see it. 30 seconds is pretty long actually. Hopefully Nintendo do something along the lines of posting it to your Nintendo account or something and can see it on your phone.

So Nintendo let's you record gameplay with the switch but if you post it to youtube they take all the revenue?  Nice.
You have to pay for multiplayer ewww...  pass.
Since you can't upload to gameplay to Youtube then why are you showing us this on YouTube? Nintendo is such a hypocrite
Worst console ever made
Does this mean you wont take peoples money from posting gameplay videos or nah
Add the virtual console ALREADY!!!
Cool can I have normal voice chat now?
A few nitpicks:\n- 30 seconds is too short\n- YouTube should definitely be an option\n- Why 480p?\n- You should be able to record AFTER you press the button (maybe press the capture button & the d-pad at the same time?)\nI'm grateful for this feature, but it can definitely be improved on in the future
30 seconds whoopee doo
This is cool but to be honest it's useless nobodies going to use it for twitter or Facebook people only would want it for YouTube and if it was longer than 30 seconds
I still want pokémon icons on the switch.  Please Nintendo actually listen to a fan this time or I'll hack my switch to have them and find an exploit to get unbanned.
The second I read this title in my notification, I started to giggle.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I respectfully disagree with people about a cats  independence/pride not having value in a support class. Yes dogs builds can do many things for humans that cats builds will never be able to do but how much is that needed by the average human overall? Dogs unfortunately need a huge amount of  maintenance daily and otherwise.\n1 food\n2 grooming, \n3 walks\n4 training\n5  space\n6 healthcare\n7 entertainment  \n8 affection \n9 time \nall this can be quit daunting to a human who just needs a moral boost and/ or some cuddling but  not so much time to support a support class. this make the cat a great choice for many stressed overworked people.\ncats do need daily maintenance but compared to the dog there is no contest.\n\n1 food independence bonus!If outdoors cat build may find food and feed themselves \n2 grooming independence bonus self grooming! *not all build types apply recommend scratch post for nail care to nullify the home degrade from cat scratch.  \n3 walks  independence bonus self walking human not needed\n4 training independence penalty! you want me do what? f that I ain't your slave. independence bonus No potty training needed! If i hide my waste in this sandbox no one will ever  know  \n5 space 'independence bonus! yard not needed\n6 healthcare needs same support \n7entertaninmet needs same support\n8 affection needs same support\n9 time independence bonus flexible time needs! time reduction up to 50% or more!
Cats vs Dogs? You mean BB gun vs M16?
if toxiplasmosis is as strong as you say, why is it that you give all of the credit to the dog class and none to the cat class?\n\nI wonder if dogs have a hidden status effect that caused the imbalance in this video :thinking:
How would one go about a meerkat build?
You are a dog person eh?  Cats help with mice and vermin by removing them from the area (saving food stores), and provide a healing buff with a purr move.... this creates a regen that affects the cat and any creature in contact with it.  I hope you see this because the purr move is the only reason why I spec'd my noobs as cat builds.  Dog builds do not have any regen abilities... and they require more effort out of players that spec'd as human.
Can we get an arachnid video?
Can you do a video on the Kangaroo class? I feel like it’s a good class but I just don’t know how to use it well.
.. I love this so much....how did I never know these existed? And I'm sporting Cat x3 + Dog x1 +... wait do pet turkey's count? They're wild but I feed them occasionally...
Every person that wants him to be biased to cats: HE'S BIASED TOWARDS DOGS, CATS HAVE SAVED HUMANS FROM INTRUDERS IN 2 CASES IN HISTORY AND COMAS!!!!!I!I!III!!II
Does that make the cat a parasite?
How should I go about building my bacteria class?
Can you do a tier list on the ants. The one species that is everywhere you go no matter what
Since Halloween is coming up could you talk about the controversial Ghost builds?
Could you talk about the bear class?
I think this video is a tad bias,  but it's ok. Adblock😎
so... cats are too good at other things to be the true best support class.
I thought this was for real life, then I thought he was talking about a video game, then then I thought he was talking about real life in a video game... I’m so confuzzled
Why was the snake not listed in the human support tier list?  Are you saying snakes aren't real pets?  But IDC, it's still a great video!
Im glad such a unique underated channel is getting some spotlight and is tending.
Id like to know more about the leaf cutter or ant meta in general
A video about owl would help out my dumbass brother who only plays crazy offensive builds
Are you this old YouTuber called antvenom?
I'm a goat build, trying to go for that mountain goat doe, need to level up my legs and my hooves i think, can you help me? i don't really know.
When everyone gets salty because the cats aren't the strongest support class.
What the fuck is going on in this video?
What about the tier list for the North American server?
You need to remember pure support classes. Cats and dogs can both play independent of humans but what about classes that support the microbiome? Humans can survive without cats dogs and other macro-scale classes but micro-scale classes are inherently necessary to their continued dominance. Of course this also affects most other players in the entire game from micro to macro so if you're analyzing around the human perspective then perhaps it's not necessary to highlight, but it's important to remember that these classes form the backbone of any and all macro-scale strategies.
True pro humans have both cats and dogs as supports. Lots of maintenance, but the payoff is ridiculous.
Do a video on the Axolotl
I still like cats
Man, the salt from catfuckers is glorious. Can't even handle shitposting if it mentions the catshit from which toxo plasmosis is spread.
Talk to me when you make a dragon guide, smh to many plebs maxing fire breathe everyone knows you max wings then scales then fire
Great content! Support classes are among my favorites.\n\nCould you explore the current rodent meta?  There are a lot of interesting and diverse specialized builds, considering they almost uniformly revolve around the (probably OP) constantly growing incisors.  \n\nAlso, how are capybara players able to spec into such a unique ability as serenity aura?  They can befriend other players with startling ease.  Is there some wololo ayoyoyo at work, or is this just playstyle?  Inquiring minds want to know.
Hey, a friend of mine swears by the tarantula specs, but I'm not sure I'm sold on the arachnid guild or if I can get past how creepy it would look. Is a arachnid build really viable?
Now let's talk about the worst class\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman,i mean we smart but not smart enough to figure out that we should stop killing each other damn griefers(also human builds have a load of debuffs)
You should do one based on some of the stranger characters like say duck-billed platypus,  Narwals, Sea Pigs,  anything else thats just kinda bizarre
love the use of the dont starve sound track
Talk about the best survival builds
First time here and its great
So glad that your videos made it to trending so that other people can see your beautiful work, keep it going man 👍
The price hike for Daraprim was for insurance companies. People can get it for really cheap.
I'd like to see you cover the banning of the Dodo Bird, it's something I don't know much about and would love to hear your take on it.
What about ranged classes? \n\n\nEtc spitting cobras spray venom to their opponent causing victims health to keep draining until death unless the opponent is too big which is usually not the case because in the desert servers (which is where they live) the opponents are usually small enough for death usually that's their main attack but if that doesn't work they aren't afraid to bite you with the same effects \n\n\n\nElement venom \nIntelligence: 40\nStealth: 70\nDefence-low (but high for its size) so: 20\nSpeed- once again low (but high for its size): 30\nHP:20\n\nAnother ranged class is the Egyptian vulture.\nEgyptian vultures pick up rocks into the air using the move flight which utilizes the air element to lift it up in the air.After the vultures pick up the stones in the air they drop the stones on eggs (an earth element move) with tough shells killing their opponents before the baby stage reducing competition but the vultures had to develop high intelligence for that sometimes they just pick up the stone and start hammering at the egg without even flying into the air.\n\nSpeed:80\nStealth:80\nAttack:30\nDefence:25\nIntelligence:80\nHP:30
Can you mention Axolotl mains and give them a few pointers? I'm not one, but I was considering wiping my previous account as a fox to try something with better health retention.
Everyone’s joking about having real classes while I’m still sitting here scarred by the dogs and cats friggin murdering anything they see
This video is on trending! Well deserved, it will get more subs! I subbed when the channel had ~15k subs. 👌
What tier is best for jungle?
Cats are the embodiement of PvP players. Selfish as hell and cheat wherever they can. Dogs form thier APvP guild to contain the cats, then get baged by dog catchers. Wow games really do model real life sometimes.
I've been looking forward to your analysis of dogs since your first video
Talk about the platypus (also I think you could revisit this topic)
You should look into the balancing of different reproductive systems. Seems completely unbalanced that some classes have to camp their own spawn point to defend against griefers for months just because they have the egg skill tree when others get the incredibly easy budding ability.
Hey so are you ever gonna cover how massively unbalanced the Human players are? When are they gonna get nerfed? They are basically playing their own game at this point.
Will you make a video discussing the importance of the defensive meta and name some specific animals that follow this build?
So dogs are good for combo attacks and cats are the healers so cats are mercy(I think that's the healers name I don't know lol)and dogs are bastion,mcree and sometimes genji
This is why I don't raid with cats, Their toxoplasma parasite infects the group as well as the main boss which leads to unfair distribution of DKP. Always in their favor :(
Blue collar humans and White collar humans
What if the devs make a Mars expansion pack? Which tiers will do well on that map?
Since you did big cats can you do canines too? I know hyenas are more related to cats but could you add em in too if you do? Thanks LOVE YOUR VIDS
Mitochondria are the best support class. Nobody in there right mind would play without one on there team.
For the dog you forgot about recognizing invisible desieses and alerting their handler
I think it's time for a video on the number 1 undisputed SSS tier human, perhaps a  light recap of guild conflicts would be interesting (tier history series when??)
#17 Trending. Congrats for making it, and definitely lookong forawrd to what's next.
Dogs: Look at this team! We're gonna do great!\n\nCats; I need healing!
Cats have some of the best escape in the game in their climbing ability and acrobatic movement.\nBeing unable to reach the same levels of pure physical power doesn't matter because a cat can simply escape whenever its in a bad matchup, unlike a dog.
When you realize you're #20 on trending, wow great moves keep it up proud of you
i don't believe in the conspiracy, it might play a small part  but its probably cats because tribes helped them cause the kill mice that eat grain, so they were a support class but not any more.
Can you explain what the hell is going on with the great Potoo?
I’m a fox main and some of us in the community have managed to befriend humans

I have a problem. I initially thought being a fish player was a good idea, but ultimately decided to make a switch. I want to make a switch to Megatherium, but my game always seems to crash when I try. I was wondering if you could make a video going over how to build with Sloths, or even how to build with the Megatherium (if my game stops crashing when I try to make one.) It would be incredibly helpful.
It's so obvious when someone is a dog main. :/\n\nCooking up conspiracy theories for why cats are such a high-ranked support class when even back in pre-release, cats remain THE most effective check for griefing mouse, rat, bird, mole, and even some lizard builds. Human players aren't really specced to handle those classes, never have been. For one thing, the larger build size of humans making it easy for smaller builds like the rodent class to easily evade them by retreating to terrain where bigger builds can't follow, allowing them to actually establish spawn points within a human player's territory and also sneak into human bases and steal valuable drops and resources directly from their storage containers. Plus, humans just dumped way too many stats into INT and its skill trees, and failed to go deep enough into the Perception skill tree to pick up on the heightened hearing, sense of smell, or even night vision perks that would help negate the lower tier classes' ability to grief them. Yeah, humans may dominate the current meta in terms of their influence on the meta itself, but the fact is that there will always be a thousand low-level players for every high-level one - and if the low-level players can grief the high-level players through sheer numbers, without being checked, that gradual erosion on the high tier player is going to start showing more and more of an effect.\n\nEnter, my friends, the cat class.\n\nThe cat class, as you noted, never made the switch from their assassin role to a support role. Why, then, are they considered a S tier support class? It's simple - the cat class never made the switch to a support role because it didn't need to. Its abilities as a stealth assassin class are exactly what human players needed, and so human players started pairing with cat players exactly as they were. The cat class comes STANDARD with all the abilities required to handle the numerous low-tier griefers that human players simply aren't equipped to, and any cat player playing solo will already BE tackling those griefers because it's the most logical, natural playstyle for anyone who specs into the class to begin with. What else are you going to do with all those stealth and attack points, especially at that build size? And then a human player comes along, sees what your class can do(that theirs can't, but desperately needs), and offers you a mutually beneficial arrangement where it shares its resources with you, in exchange for your doing exactly what you were already doing - just in their territory. Like I said, you can look back through past versions of the game all the way back to pre-1.0 and see this logic at work, with cat and human players teaming up as early as the Ancient Egyptian expansion.\n\nAnd all this is talking purely in terms of PVP game mechanics, and how the cat class helps shore up the human class' weakness to griefing. I'm not even getting into the fact that the cat class has aesthetic values of its own, or how they've invested points in the vocalization tree to communicate more effectively with human players - it's an essentially worthless perk when dealing with any other class, even other cat players - or their own INT stats that sometimes let them spec into other skills - even some normally associated with the dog class. I haven't even brought up the Purr perk, which - aside from being considered soothing by many players - actually comes with a small but not insignificant regen buff.\n\nSo who really needs to explain it as a conspiracy theory involving a cat-bacteria support relationship somehow manipulating human players, when there's such obvious logic to this team dynamic? It's blatant dog class bias. Especially when the article you cite shows that it's an estimate of BETWEEN 30-50% have been exposed to T. gondii, and MAY have been infected. So that's not a guarantee of how many human players have been infected, even the percentage of exposed human players could be as much as 20% lower as you state aloud(meaning you're skewing high on purpose), and - at MAXIMUM - you've only accounted for half of all human players. It also ignores the fact that for a human player to acquire the T. gondii debuff, they have to already HAVE exposure to the cat class. Isn't it logical to assume that the support pairing may have pre-dated the application of the debuff, then? After all, how would human players be getting the debuff if they had no reason to associate with the cat class to begin with?\n\nThis also ignores the statistics that - based on the statistics of US players alone - 36% of human players team up with dogs, and 30% of human players team up with cats. So for all those scare tactic statistics, human-cat support teams are LESS numerous than human-dog support teams! But I guess the popularity of the dog class is just because they're just that amazing, right? (And, to be fair - they are. No hate to any dog mains out there; I can't argue with the facts that dogs are practically OP as a support build. I'm just tired of people sleeping on the fact that the cat class have EARNED their place in S tier, as much as the dog class has...and it always seems to be dog class stans who act like the cat class cheated its way to the top.) And, of course, this is assuming that out of the MAYBE 50% of human players there are who have the T. gondii debuff, all 100% of human-cat support teams fall within that tentative 50%. That seems pretty statistically unlikely, doesn't it?\n\nIt's pretty telling that the same player who made the video about all the positive qualities of the feline builds somehow forgot all the virtues of those builds when talking about the feline build that ~happens~ to be in direct competition with another popular support build...I'm not saying the T. gondii debuff is completely insignificant, but when that's the only aspect of the build you focus on, it stops being a 'VS' video and becomes a fluff piece for your favorite class because there's no genuine comparison being made. :/ Disappointing.
Iguana is the true support meta. It's the only service animal issued to counteract the dreaded 'crippling depression' debuff.\n\nToxoplasma and enemy detection are no good if your human party leader went and ate the business end of a shotgun while you're stuck in the house.
talk about the ocean sunfish build
I started as a human how do I restart?
First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\n\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\n\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\n\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.
that yellowstone reference killed me
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
not sure if this even gets to you with almost 4k comments, just wanne say good choice of music and really good video keep it up
But what about the cats that work for humans??  IE: ship cats that control rodent populations on ships. Or cats that control rodent populations in exchange for affection? Why would cats bring owners their food? Also, cats were originally a team style build (see: lions). They live in “colonies” that support each other much like wolf packs.
Please make a video on flies
What game is that?
Please talk about the MANTIS SHRIMP! It's claws move like a .22 caliber rifle and it can boil water just by moving.
how about a video on the viable bat builds
Dog maining elitist here forgot to mention how cat's make great defensive units when you're hoarding resources, and also boost immunity to certain diseases.  They have a strong morale boosting AOE, but the strength has a greater variability than the dog class.  Overall, their stats tend to vary more.  In some cases they can even exceed that of a dog.
Have you considered talking about  deep sea animals for Halloween?
See, cats purr. Can dogs purr? No. That is why cats are better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy cat hates me. I pet her too much
The cat and dog classes are pretty good with their own reasons but nothing can beat a falcon’s air strike. Air strike takes quite some leveling up to get but once you get it, it becomes overkill. I like to pair air strike with bird eyes for increased accuracy.
Many say the sea cucumber is man's best friend.
i want to play the horseshoe crab build, can you give me the low down on its viability?
Great video about supports for human players but would you mind going into more detail on legacy patches where humans weren't the only choice in the Homo genus?
do the best dog class
I'd love to see an analysis and guide for a primate build
How do you unlock the dog class
Please talk about the meta between rival ant teams?
Give us a dive gorilla build
I'm waiting for the sloth video, the most troll build in the game. Sloths offer great stealth and are so unattractive that very few other players even consider killing it. While the movement seems very basic there are a lot of aspects to master, today we see a lot of sloth players randomly dropping from trees and thus killing themselves. Definitely F tier but a highly interesting PvE build choice.
If it wasn't for cats, our ancestors would have all died of plague when humans began building cities. You know, because large stores of grain attract disease ridden rodents.
You say stole the top spot. I say Cats achieved the top spot. Survival of the fittest, b. Not a felines fault they managed to domesticated humans without having to learn stupid tricks. If dogs were smarter, they could have...lol. No, they couldn't.\n\nCats have always been, and will always be the supreme winners.
You think we could either get a human subclass tier list or a multipart bacterial one
Hey, um, microverse server player here (tuberculosis, yes I hated the antibiotics buff humans got), and I was wondering if the virus class is actually playable? I see them everywhere but they don't appear in the character creation menu. Are they even a playable class?
Dogs have an actual use cats just eat food and give no shits
500k or 1 mil why humans need a nerf.
What the music at 1:00 from?
I like how u ack like it is a game
i like the dont starve music
Everyone is talking about which class is better. Cat or dog? Welp, the answer is simple. If you get Positive support classes, you can have both. Not only do I reap the benefits of purr, I also get the protection of Bark.\n\nWhy choose one support style when you can have both!
What about parrot builds? I'm trying to figure out the pros and cons of all the builds and I need some help.
i wouldn't dream about EVER being forced to choose. I wouldn't tolerat it becuz its like choosing between ur children. They both thoroughly allow my heart all the magic it can hold...and MORE. Hellfire, I need some horses too, chickens maybe, throw in cpl turtles, i want a zoo. The more---the better. Life is all that better.
I would love to hear about mollusks in the meta. Specifically why gastropods like snails are so low on the tier list.
Dogs are much more work but a better support class
87 intelligence for dogs? ..... wow. I mean they are very lovable, but if you look at nature dogs really don't cut the mustard when it comes to intelligence. They are kind of not that high to be honest.
I like the don't starve soundtrack.
You forgot to mention many of cats unique abilities. Like being able to use way points and access to online maps to navigate back home no matter where a cat winds up. Or their passive ability that some spec into like ESP. Emotional sensor patrol.
Human and a whale shark build makes a overpowered aquarium,\n also do a build on alpacas.
Friendly reminder that users are stupid and will delete cat characters over the toxoplasmosis meme.\n\nPlease don't casually perpetuate it, dog mains.
I'm confused about my new build. I play a Cassowary, and I'm not sure how I should play.
Your channel is the first one I've ever supported on Patreon your content is amazing.
Can you talk about the parasite vs. commensal vs. support (mutualism) builds and which is best? Also a video about how cows are lowkey just giant exosymbiotic parasites of the bacteria living inside them would be awesome (only doing 20% of their own digestion, are you kidding me?).
The bird tier list. Make it happen.
I think an analysis of the megafauna trait would be fun and interesting
Please make a video about rat builds and their possibilities
Could you cover how humans have become more and more overpowered in recent patches?
just wondering, is there anything planned on ants?
Dog players actually have little to no control in how they want to spec, you are at the mercy of your human player.
Can we go over how the Human's two main passives, Craft and Augment, as well as its extremely high IQ stat have made it an undisputed top tier unit despite having mid to low HP, atk, def and stealth?
Nope cats are life cats help like u said but they also are the only self domesticated animal on the earth aka they CHOSE to stay with humans
Dog, if you want to care for a mammal that will love you in return for caring. Cat, if you're lonely and want a furry buddy nearby, and just want to set the food and water out.
Curious how Bear builds are doing in the meta. I’m considering maining one but I’m not sure what I want to spec
Can you give some advice on the platypus build?
The platypus is where it's at.
I was watching those videos for a month or so, and just now I understood the joke: tier means beast in German.
I would argue that in the current game meta, cats are the far superior support class. \nNot only do they grant the same initial buff that dog players do, but they also unlock the regeneration buff “Purr” \nIf you choose an inside or outside style cat player, you are also granted guarantees to a disease free guild hall caused by other low tier players such as rodents and birds. Much more effective in the most recent meta as the dog players “hunting” ability is much less needed with the current tech upgrades \nIt’s also interesting to note that while almost any cat class breed will grant the same buffs, not all dog class breeds will have the same effectiveness regarding the higher level buffs they have access to. \nCat classes also require much less player maintenance than dog classes, especially when choosing the outside cat class. \nAnother big thing to consider when looking at Support classes is the amount of time needed to reach specific buffs and the longevity of the support class chosen. While it can take years for dog classes to reach their max potential, cat classes main features are accessed within a few months. Dog classes also have an effective life span of 7-11 years of you choose the proper breed, while cats will remain good Support classes for up to 18 years or older. \n\nWhile the dog class has a lot of fancy buffs a human player can cultivate and gain access to, if you look at the time needed, the effectiveness in the current meta, the maintenance of he support class, and the life span of your companion, there really is no competition.
What purpose do hedgehogs have in their server?
Man I really wish they would turn tier zoo into a real game series.
Brb euthanising both my cats in favour of dog class.
I would like to see your tier placement of the Common Raven. Maybe along with the Elephant and Killer Whale as intelligent, social animals. I believe those three are top tier S class that inhabit Air, Land, and Sea.
What are your favorite builds?
Time to purge the cat class.
This is God damn genius!!!!!!!
Yeah, you have to train a dog for all those buffs. Doesn’t count
The music choices you used are amazing.
The runescape music in the beginning gave me nostalgia
D I S L I K E.
You should talk about the arthropod guild. the spider and insect classes have immense prevalence in the meta and ignoring them would be a mistake.
Would you ever think of splitting mobility into speed and dexterity?\nAlso, would someone care to explain the difference between defense and hp? I understand defense is kinda like armor but would there be a case of an animal with high hp and terrible defense or one with high defense and low hp?
Lmao teammates? You mean servants lol
Kodiak grizzly? Best 1v1?

Dogs are for physical builds, cats are for magical builds. Duh.\n\nDog bark: protection buff\nCat purr: healing buff

talk about the ocean sunfish build
First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\n\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\n\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\n\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.
To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
Please do a honey badger video they're such cute little deadly devils
Have you heard about the word?
Says dogs are the top of the meta\n\nGoes on to explain how cats are actually the top of the meta, while dogs are the strongest class.
I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.

Talk about bears and raccoons.  Please shit on how awful pandas are
Could you do one on eusocial insects? What tier are fire ants? I'm planning on playing as a fire ant colony for my next playthrough.
I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
What about the fast that cats help keep the rodent players from griefing human storages?
I feel so cheesy playing the Human class.
You mentioned Bat builds in your previous video but haven't actually gone in depth with them, I'm thinking on starting one up but want to know what I'm getting into first
Yup, cats are the haxorz. We pown your brain. But hey if it wasn't for stray cats we would be plauged by vermin.
that yellowstone reference killed me
I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
so glad you mentioned toxoplasma. will you cover more parasite builds?
Can you talk about the mantis shrimp class
Can you do a honeybadger build video. Good atk. Great defense. And even poison resistance feats.
What the “Maned Wolf” class. Are the long legs an ability or some kind of model glitch.
I love the DS music.
You just blew my mind.
But you forgot what happened on the MacQuire Island server. Cats were banned, and rats crashed the server (along with rabbits, but rabbits don't grief nearly as hard as rats). Seabird players at least at least had a fighting chance with cat players, but cats are a hard-counter against rats. And trust me, if any player can crash a server, it is rats.\n\nGranted, the concern was the feral cat subclass as opposed to the outdoor cat playthrough, but similar effects either way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gqOzTh2pjEw?t=12m27s
A look at where Bears and its sub-classes fit in the meta would be interesting.
My dog is ok but my cat is an asshole is this some kind of game
Man I know its hard work but I really wish you uploaded more, these are awesome.
You forgot to talk about the cats' primary support ability, their purr, which only support builds and a few offensive builds can spec into at all. It's one of the few abilities that provides a heal, and it's an AoE heal at that, on top of its other benefits. It's insanely broken.
Fable the lost chapters music?
Anybody got tips for making a good Skunk build? I know they're not really in the meta, I just think they're adorable.
I have a friend who is caught between a red panda and a raccoon build. Can you help clear up some of the confusion for these two common builds?
I've been showing this video to everyone. I have two cats, and I just don't see them the same anymore. Now I want a dog, you jerk. Seriously, though, your videos are downright fascinating.
This is just me but I don't like dogs \n\n\n\n\n\nI taste the dislikes now
Have you considered making a twitter and posting images of the tier lists you've done as well as maybe a sidebit or extra piece of analysis on a specific class that otherwise wouldn't make sense in a video?
PLAY OF THE GAME: Doggo as Dog: 76
Stop being a cheapskate and just buy the expansion so you can have two supp classes.
What makes the human build almost game breaking in the current meta
But what about the cats that work for humans??  IE: ship cats that control rodent populations on ships. Or cats that control rodent populations in exchange for affection? Why would cats bring owners their food? Also, cats were originally a team style build (see: lions). They live in “colonies” that support each other much like wolf packs.
Please make a video on flies

I'm confused about my new build. I play a Cassowary, and I'm not sure how I should play.
Can you talk about the parasite vs. commensal vs. support (mutualism) builds and which is best? Also a video about how cows are lowkey just giant exosymbiotic parasites of the bacteria living inside them would be awesome (only doing 20% of their own digestion, are you kidding me?).
How have I never seen this before! omfg literally, dictionary definition, of hilarious! I'm in an asylum now.

You can play almost any class as human-support.  I just came back from the snakes video, thinking what about pets?  I main Ball Python, my character is the most boopable snek in the world!~
I remember the days of when the horse was way too op. The human group called mongols destroyed other human players using horse players as supports. They were way too op.
I'm really curious about the Abyssal Plane servers and their meta. I've heard there is this weird class called a Blobfish.
While the available builds are yet to be optimized, if you create a Mineralia character, robot guild is looking like it'll be pretty good as far as support classes go.\n\nIncidentally, would you mind discussing the now-removed pterosaur guild, and what it brought to the table in terms of how to get a high-weight (and potentially high-power, see also the legendary Hatzegopteryx build) build while retaining and optimizing the flight ability?
We need capybara and the slime mold
You should have a video about which overpowered builds (for their niche) should be nerfed

How about looking at the past meta at oceanic preds. How they rised & fell and if there might be hold outs still refusing to quit.\n\nAlso might be interesting if the devs might bring back some of these builds since there have been possible leaks of some subclasses returning to the current meta.

So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.\n\nDo you think this ability has any real use or effect in the current meta ?\n\nJan 27, 2003\nWhy do cats purr? - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/
This should *actually* be a real game.
I love your videos mate, keep it up !
I don’t understand why human mains even have support classes, I mean they are REALLY over powered. True human’s base and max strength is by no means the most threatening in the game but the devs gave human mains a way to high intelligence. Not only this but if humans speck even more into intelligence (especially with the “school” side quests) they can not only build homes that are practically impossible for any other players besides rat/mouse and insect mains to enter; plus the new Computer Buff they added just a little while ago human mains can practically watch the rest of us whenever they want. What I said here was barely even the tip of the ice berg, basically humans need a major debuff soon.\n- sincerely a sword fish main
I've noticed in my marine play throughs I've come across supportive microbial classes. I was just wondering at how available this class is to regular players since I've always started my upgrade tree past unicellular. I want to try and spec into algae, but I don't know where to start.

Cats actually make pretty good support for humans. Throughout the game they've helped humans get rid of pest problems, such as mice and other rodents, who try to steal their food. And during Dark Age expansion, a lot of human players would have survived the bubonic plague if they didn't kill cats. See humans were affected by paranoia at the time and associated cats with the supernatural. They killed cats thinking it would prevent the sickness from spreading, when in actuality it did the opposite. If cats weren't hunted down at the time, they would have killed more rodents, the carriers of the plague, which would have lead to less human players getting wiped.
I need help. I started a party with both a Cat and Dog on my Human main thinking it would be new meta. But both players just cant work together which lead to me having to carry the team with no proper support. Your video made me consider ditching the Cat player but my character is already infected by the toxoplasma passive. What do I do?

I'm not too much of the creative type but I would love to see a video done about chimps monkeys and other primates
Can you talk about the highest and lowest tier characters?
Ugh, that toxoplasmosis nonsense is ridiculously overplayed. And talk about bias, what about cats not being banned on Middle Eastern servers?
The Khajiit has wares if you have the coin
Great video, dude. I was curious about the best common support class for human players. I've seen some go with less-than-common supports that really don't seem like they actually fit as supports, but allow the human plays to absolutely excel in certain servers, primarily when they're under-equipped. You ever seen a human with the street vendor prestige with a panther or jaguar playing support? There's a very popular video showcasing one of these players with a fucking lion support in south africa. Try to gank that guy, I'd dare you!\n\nOne thing that's really strange to me is why anyone would actively play mosquito. They've got to be the lowest tier out of all the insect players, somewhere lower than E tier. Their natural predators don't even require them for their own playthroughs! The devs could totally wipe all mosquito players from the game, banning them permenantly, and the only class that would even notice would be the human players. That's a level beyond low tier if I've ever seen it. Even housefly players aren't that useless. What does a mosquito main even do all day? They have some of the shortest playthroughs I can even think of and are less effective at making an actual change in the meta than something like yersinia pestis players, who you'll remember damn near banned humans from the european continent earlier this season (of course that was with great help from rat players and there's a huge debate on whether or not it would've even been possible without the rat flea mains) \n\nAnyway I look forward to more of your analysis of the current meta. You're clearly quite familiar with a lot of the mechanics of the game.
There are couple builds that are suporisingly vital for the current meta:\nBees keep 85% of all servers flowers going,\nBats keep pest-insect -players at bay by harassing 99% of their builds &\nWhale-players' excerement keep certain CO2-eating -alagaes alive, thus indirectly keeping the new Climate Change-event at bay (well at least slows it). (Information from science-magazine Tieteen Kuvalehti) Then there are also vulture-players, that by devouring carcasses prevent some diseases from spreading to thr rest of the server.\n\nI'd be happy to hear about these true MVP-builds!\n\nThanks for stupid/smart/original content!
Do the human build,It’s what I main and I’m kind of just sitting in a Jai-I mean school,and Ist really boring.
The next patch, Tremors of Yellowstone looks to be a blast.
Dang RuneScape soundtrack in the beginning brings back so much memories
I kinda wish some company would actually make a game where you can actually play on the entire earth as different species like the stuff you do on your channel
Why are bees S tier?
if you want to choose a really good dog build, I suggest the Black Russian Terrier, they will work much more like a bear, they were trained initially to chase escaping prisoners from Gulags, they will present the strength and the likeliness of a bear, and still keep all  the strengths of a dog.
Do an insect tier list.
Cats are junglers or a damage support, while dogs are heavily reliant on their human carry to progress, while when multiple cat plahers have a lazy human player they can still strive and also cats scaling in the African servers are broken and dominate the meta
Ok so dogs _can_ be useful with specialty skill sets (even though they're usually only companions) however it's important to realize the overall cost to the human player. A dog is like having a perpetual child who is very needy, drawn toward self-destructive behaviors, and makes messes readily (often unintentionally griefing their own human companions.) Cats, however, are like college students. They aren't completely independent but if you make the correct resources available, they can usually make due on their own very well. They also cause little accidental griefing comparatively and do not have the aggression buffs of most dogs so they can more easily live side by side with other players in a human-led party who they might normally consider prey (like birds and fish.)
Bat class tier \nFor mammal players that want bird perks
what about the alleged healing properties of a cat's purr? That's a pretty useful support ability.
I love your videos. I have some questions:\nIs friendly fire cannibalism?\nIn Tier zoo, if it is possible, what are Prestige class? (class you can only unlock by upping a basic class like becoming palladin after warrior).

You can play almost any class as human-support.  I just came back from the snakes video, thinking what about pets?  I main Ball Python, my character is the most boopable snek in the world!~
I remember the days of when the horse was way too op. The human group called mongols destroyed other human players using horse players as supports. They were way too op.
Hey,can you make a insects guide,the bee and mosquito/wasp are like the pistol srimph,all DPS but are kinda of a support too!look at the bee,it has a stinger and armor,looks like a great bruiser build,dosnt it??well,human player farm them for the honey consumable and the wax crafting material,and are one of the few classes that SINERGISES with plant kindom players,and look  at the mosquito,similar,and supports a DPS class:the Malaria build,giving them a GIGANTIC spd boost and the the ability to go though skin buff,giving the GIGANTIC DoT on human players is so fun!make a guide on them,NOW!!
What you say about Cats is true, but imprecise. Remember back in the Bronze Age days when Mice and other species griefed Humans' crops? Before Human players realised they were the absolute top-tier class? I remember when Cats in most Egypt servers were extremely popular, employed to hunt vermin and protect the crops, so much so that it became a meme religion akin to twitch's Helix Fossil; then again, a good 90% of Egypt servers' religion was based on class memes, and you could even argue that it was born out of Toxoplasma Gondiis' trolling.\n\nAfter BA was over, Cat memes got old and were particularly hated in Europe servers during Medieval Age. Black Cats were particularly hated, and most of the time their Human supportees were unreasonably hunted down simply for collaborating even once. I mean, I know those memes were bad, I still remember them, but why kill other Human players over them, even the newbies?\n\nThen that became a meme and luckly unfunny class memes came to a stop, for a while at least.\n\nNowadays Cat supports aren't used anymore in crop farming (AKA farm farming) because we have better Farmer weapons and skills for Humans in 1stWC servers along with P2W consumables to protect the crops, but if it wasn't for TPG existing and Cats lacking CC, they would be the absolute top-tier support/hunter hybrid class.\n\nI'm a Chow Chow support Dog main btw. Sorry if this comment sounded biased.
You're growing so fast, when you grow even more hopefully some game company will help you actually make the game. Would be awesome
I'm really curious about the Abyssal Plane servers and their meta. I've heard there is this weird class called a Blobfish.
While the available builds are yet to be optimized, if you create a Mineralia character, robot guild is looking like it'll be pretty good as far as support classes go.\n\nIncidentally, would you mind discussing the now-removed pterosaur guild, and what it brought to the table in terms of how to get a high-weight (and potentially high-power, see also the legendary Hatzegopteryx build) build while retaining and optimizing the flight ability?
We need capybara and the slime mold
You should have a video about which overpowered builds (for their niche) should be nerfed
Watching this as a have 1 cat laying on my legs and another sleeping around my neck/head, I feel like I might be a tad biased.
How about looking at the past meta at oceanic preds. How they rised & fell and if there might be hold outs still refusing to quit.\n\nAlso might be interesting if the devs might bring back some of these builds since there have been possible leaks of some subclasses returning to the current meta.
Explain the immortal jelly and how it has been breaking the meta for as long as it existed!
Could you do an analysis of the arachnid tier?
I need a build for a Hippo, and i'd also like to know the canine tier list to see if my fennec fox is meta right now.
I'm interested in your opinion of the viability of the blue ringed octopus build
What about the cervidae builds?
So where I agree with you about dogs in general I do think you missed some key cat abilities like the cat's pur ability is basically an AOE heal for anyone close enough to receive not only the bonus to happiness the purr gives off but also The Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.\n\nDo you think this ability has any real use or effect in the current meta ?\n\nJan 27, 2003\nWhy do cats purr? - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/
This should *actually* be a real game.
I love your videos mate, keep it up !
I don’t understand why human mains even have support classes, I mean they are REALLY over powered. True human’s base and max strength is by no means the most threatening in the game but the devs gave human mains a way to high intelligence. Not only this but if humans speck even more into intelligence (especially with the “school” side quests) they can not only build homes that are practically impossible for any other players besides rat/mouse and insect mains to enter; plus the new Computer Buff they added just a little while ago human mains can practically watch the rest of us whenever they want. What I said here was barely even the tip of the ice berg, basically humans need a major debuff soon.\n- sincerely a sword fish main
I've noticed in my marine play throughs I've come across supportive microbial classes. I was just wondering at how available this class is to regular players since I've always started my upgrade tree past unicellular. I want to try and spec into algae, but I don't know where to start.
Aren't you concerned that the video might be taken down for the music?
I dont know how you only have so low subs. Your content is so well written and displayed! I literaly have shown your videos to everyone on my college so dont worry the word will spread quick!
Cats actually make pretty good support for humans. Throughout the game they've helped humans get rid of pest problems, such as mice and other rodents, who try to steal their food. And during Dark Age expansion, a lot of human players would have survived the bubonic plague if they didn't kill cats. See humans were affected by paranoia at the time and associated cats with the supernatural. They killed cats thinking it would prevent the sickness from spreading, when in actuality it did the opposite. If cats weren't hunted down at the time, they would have killed more rodents, the carriers of the plague, which would have lead to less human players getting wiped.
Is the Mantis Shrimp an S tier class?
Please do a honey badger video they're such cute little deadly devils
Have you heard about the word?
Says dogs are the top of the meta\n\nGoes on to explain how cats are actually the top of the meta, while dogs are the strongest class.
I want to start a bird of prey build but I don't know which to go for. My friends say go Bald Eagle and hope for a United States Spawn but I'm not so sure, Crows have high int (Valuable trait), but a peregrine falcon surely has the most intense gameplay! Help TierZoo!
I need help. I started a party with both a Cat and Dog on my Human main thinking it would be new meta. But both players just cant work together which lead to me having to carry the team with no proper support. Your video made me consider ditching the Cat player but my character is already infected by the toxoplasma passive. What do I do?
I love this shit
Can you please talk about the human build.
Cats are more of a jungle class I believe, Sneaky assassins and all.
WARNING⚠️\n\n\nIn the comments you will find:\n99% People writing essays about why cats are better that have also Never owned a dog \n1% this comment
Talk about bears and raccoons.  Please shit on how awful pandas are
Could you do one on eusocial insects? What tier are fire ants? I'm planning on playing as a fire ant colony for my next playthrough.
I run an inside cat and spec into the “it lays down and does nothing” class
Most emotional people love cat's in less emotional people Dont they rather the dog. See how I said less 😂
What's the music playing in the background?
You could talk about why dinossaurs got banned.
What about the wolf build
Dogs?  Dogs are the best support class?  Compared to cats, sure, but dogs ain't horses.
Probably a dog. Knowing a cat, they'd probably take over the fighter's role and take over the world, too.
do top 10 best S tiers in general!
Why is the rhino D tier?\n\n\n\nWhile low on intelligence, its high defenses, damage, and decent speed compensate for its lack of utility. \n\n\nIt has one of the best charge attacks in the game imo.
Remember that time black death players caused a server wipe for human players?
Please please just do dogs I really love the American Bulldog if you can clue it I will greatly appreciate it love you videos
I sure cats hacks! I sure, way to high kdr.
Talk about the moose build!
You should cover the wall builds in the current meta. Like how the Tortoise poured all of its stats into defense at the expense of all of it's other stats. Or maybe even a Toxic Stall set like the Komodo Dragon? I really want to know if any of these builds are viable in the current meta as of the recent pollution patch. Thanks!
Cats are great as a defense towards the pest players. Not only is EXP abundant, but they may get extra from human players if they did great! They also have the Predator click ability, which increases accuracy. Please note that this ability has to be charged up in order to get the accuracy boost. Although cats may not be a good support class, they are good as a defense class as long as the player knows what they're doing.
Can you inform us about all the balance patches until this day?
To me, the cat build is superior because the cosmetic specialization done by human players to them each year has not affected them. \n\nMany dog classes have suffered to their strength or defense stats because of this, and now suffer many disease de-buffs
I can't tell if this is a joke or if there's a secret game I'm not picki mg up on
Took me years to figure out the basic controls
Def need an bird tier list. Really want to see where you'd put an african crowned eagle.
Why aren't viruses included on tier lists like bacteria are? Are they not players?
Please do opossum vs racoon. Opossum mains cant accept the fact that they wasted their points on feign death once humans entered the meta. Theyre just salty because racoons just ks and xp farm humans. like srsly what else are we gonna do with garbage defence and hp.
Rank the best builds to troll S+tier players. (pests in the home)
Heeey... song name?
Bear Tier
Honey badgers!
Dog playas represent.
So basically cats are useless
YELLOWSTONE SUPERVOLCANO BALANCE PATCH\nBACK UP ALL FILES

Have you not caused enough damaged a silly white kid jumped over the white house gate to catch a Charizard. Stop it we obviously can't catch them all! Also mind where you place Pokemons like the white house, North Korea, volcanoes, and Kim Kardashians butt. Places like that. Stay awesome Pikachu.

If you are playing Pokémon go you're a Russian agent :)
It's so beautiful that Lavander  Town music is played at  night time in  the game.
Quote from Pokemongolive (official site): You’ll also earn extra Candy while you’re out trick-or-treating with your Buddy Pokémon: Candy rewards from catching, hatching, and transferring Pokémon will be doubled, and your buddy will find Candy twice as fast during the Halloween celebration! \nthis isn't true. walking with your buddy still only gives 1 candy

Does anyone still play this
My unpopular opinion: gen 3 is overrated, gen 4 is underrated. Please respect opinions, even if you don't agree with them
A feeble attempt of making the game popular which will only last for about 3 weeks before it dies once again.
And here's your 3rd update for the entire year!
I caught the Halloween pickachu today. Made my day. and I didn't even have to go outside I just turned on the app and I also caught some of the other Halloween pokemon as well I believe i'm only missing one.

I learned all this stuff a year ago I even read a book on Nintendo
Nintendo was founded in 1889. Did anyone fact check this video.
My mom played Super Mario on the NES when she was little!
I guess the whole land lord thing inspired hotel mario
its not 1886 its 1889 do your research
Time to waste $60 next week (for good purposes)
Was I the only one who was kinda disgusted when she said peach princess?
The video is pretty fitting, considering Mario Odyssey comes out in a week. It's hype!
Fun Fact: one of Mario's original names were middle-aged guy
Peach Princess\nThis video instantly lost all credibility.
Jump man Jump man Jump man that boy up to somethin
Im pretty sure we all know he got his name from Mario Segali
The first thing you don't know: Princess peach is the peach princess.
That's not mario, thats FLINSTONES.

uh you werent exact it was 1889 not 1886
I thought he got the name and mustache because *_He’s a god damn italian_*
Why didn't you show Mario 2 or 3 when you put the cartridge in? The best ones!
1889 actually, get your History right, great big story
Remember when Mario was Still  Plumber. Good Times.

The video is pretty fitting, considering Mario Odyssey comes out in a week. It's hype!
Fun Fact: one of Mario's original names were middle-aged guy
Peach Princess\nThis video instantly lost all credibility.
Jump man Jump man Jump man that boy up to somethin
Im pretty sure we all know he got his name from Mario Segali
The first thing you don't know: Princess peach is the peach princess.
That's not mario, thats FLINSTONES.
0:11 YOU HAD ONE JOB!
uh you werent exact it was 1889 not 1886
I thought he got the name and mustache because *_He’s a god damn italian_*
Why didn't you show Mario 2 or 3 when you put the cartridge in? The best ones!
1889 actually, get your History right, great big story
Remember when Mario was Still  Plumber. Good Times.
THE LEGEND HAS SPOKEN!!
When mario breaks up with peach\nMario:were breaking up\nPeach: way?!\nMario:its not you it's a me mario
it is not a mustache it's a dirty sanchez
bro I been knew all this shit
so the lack of art skill to draw hair is what cause mario to wear a hat lol
5:53 IS THAT GENIUS ADVERTISING OR IS IT A RANDOM NAME?
I actually played sonic the hedgehog as a child
Luigi god his name from GASP LEO LAIGI LUIGI
Lueeeeegeeeee, you gotta go save the *Peach Princess*
Oh, I know mario cuz matpat told me so if you wanna know who mario really is, go watch his videos at his channel game theorist
One of the first
IT'S A ME- A-MARIO
What's the intro song? That's fire
I've played Mario karts However as an Italian I've always found it very disturbing
Don't like my comment
I love how Miyamoto pronounces Luigi as WEEGEE <3 YES! The meme lives!
why do you have to get sponsored by cnn
Trending omg I’m so proud of this channel \nLike if u agree
*oh boy this make me so happy*
Super nintendo dirty as hell
Name of song?
Yawnssss... Old news.

0:20 *your favorite not-so-plumber anymore italian.
Yea I already know this....
Whoa...
0:19\nMy favourite is luigi
I can trick you\n\n\n\nRead more
I never liked Mario games and I don't understand the extreme overhype around these silly games series.
Almost as good as PS4's 60 minutes recording.\nAlmost.😝
30 seconds? I'm gonna end up with a lot of wasted memo- wait you can change the length? Nevermind. Good job Nintendo. You are better than Microsoft because of the fact that you don't force us to make a 30 second recording when we only needed 3. Oh and also you make better games and DON'T sacrifice local multi-player for graphics. (looking at you halo 5).
I WAS WAITING FOR ThIS TO SHOW EVERYBODY MY SKILL ON SPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLASPLAAAATOOOON\nAhem sorry x)
I’m looking forward to using this feature. Now I just have to think of something original.
Lets just hope the nintendo switch can be a success all its life, remember what happened to the dreamcast. Those days...
That’s awesome but still waiting for Nintendo to release an update where they ENABLE BLUETOOTH for audio devices. I want to use my Bluetooth headset on the go.
Nintendo, you guys are awesome! Thank you for adding this amazing feature!
So I still have to buy something to record my switch still? Well this sucks
Well I came here thinking that they would allow you to capture long videos to post just for them to have you take them down.\nBut I guess a 30 second click posted to facebook or twitter isn't that bad... I mean unless they ask you to take those down too lol
And then have your capture immediately cease-and-desisted!
Can't upload videos on Youtube. :(
Add the virtual console ALREADY!!!
They shoul've been as long as probably 10 minutes or at least have better quality
How backlogged was this video?
Now NINTEND since your trying to be like everyone else why don't you try one more thing like everyone else and let us share with people on YouTube
Ah yes, lets give people the option to capture videos on our newest system!....except we won't let them upload it on video sharing sites!
Don't buy this rubbish👌
Wait, what? This doesn't work for ALL Switch games?! C'mon, Nintendo... :'(
It's a step in the right direction, but man they have a long way to go. I love shadowplay so much
I'm worried Nintendo is slowly turning into Microsoft
When I get a switch with splatoon 2 \n\nI’m gonna capture a video of the inkling creator
The switch is still relevant??
This is perfect!! Now if we could only post straight to instagram...
This is just a test run on video capture for the Switch. It reminds me of the Share functionality on the PS4. I don't mind the short length of 30 seconds since Nintendo plans to extend it to around 5 minutes or more in the future.
they know they can't do a whole minute because the Nintendo switch has no space
And yet, you still can’t text these pictures and videos to people on your Switch friends list...
30 seconds doesn´t seems like much, but if this gets popular enough, they´ll surely improove it.\nI mean... they found a way to record video with the 3DS so... everything is possible!
So uhhh why’s this in trending
Can you get the game planet caserster
Welp, I finished zelda and now you add this??
I think they should create Nintendo Drive app for any device. I'm sure there is a way to share on other social media sites. Like with Xbox & PlayStation. 😊
Gimme a Nintendo switch or i’ll swear on a Christian Minecraft server
Does Nintendo have something against Google and YouTube?
Great addition, Nintendo! The game recording could be a bit smoother.... but I've just tested it while undocked. But definitely want smoother videos (if possible)
this idea would have been WAAAY better if you could record for at least 30 minutes
This would be cooler if you could hit the capture button and it recorded the last 30 secs you just played, instead of recording for 30 secs after you push the button. The weirdest things happen in games when you least expect it.
I want The nintendo Switch
full of surprises not really, you guys mentioned this when you aired the console.. also.. make the video capture better 30 seconds is not enough for anyone xD
About time, so where's the Virtual Console, huh Nintendo?
This is Not Video Capture is Social Capture But Can You Make anither Video Capture Where we can Stop Recording at Any time and Don't Have to Hold the Capture Button and Like Make a Record In Settings or Stream In Settings,Please! I really want To record For Any Minutes
So its the same as xbox game dvr
This is awesome and I actually have an Elgato. Much more convenient than that of the PS4 and Xbox One. For those that think little of this, the Xbox One just recently went from a 5-minute limit to 30. I believe the PS4 is still 15 minutes. Keep in mind that both of these consoles can barely fit in a backpack while most of the memory is taken up by game installs. A single button press.
Why is only compatible with 4 games? Is that Nintendo’s way of testing and rolling out the new features?
If video can upload to youtube i think will better
Is this gonna be like smash bros, where the clips delete after each patch?
Cant we just be exited for a feature? I mean, Xbox has it, and you'll probably be able to Stream to Twitch in online 2018
I gave a thumbs up, Subscribed and Hit the bell, thanks!
yes, although it's disappointing it's only 30 seconds
I just go the update and I was excited but as soon as it was done my left joy con wouldn’t connect in tv or table top mode\n\nEdit: i even realized that I have to update my joycon and it still didn’t work
this seems pretty cool, but please nintendo. can you raise the video time at LEAST 30 more seconds?
i could care less because it doesnt even post to youtube, but if they add a youtube option to editing and posting, that would be AWESOME.
Hi can you send me one for FREEEEEEE
Why did you ban 8BitDo controllers Nintendo stop being so greedy!
Can you also record Mario + Rabbits Kindom Battle?????
Please Netflix!🤗

30 sec? i better using my phone to record that
why 30 secs wtf nintendo :(
Why just 30 seconds?
You have to pay for multiplayer ewww...  pass.
Since you can't upload to gameplay to Youtube then why are you showing us this on YouTube? Nintendo is such a hypocrite
Does this mean you wont take peoples money from posting gameplay videos or nah
30 second isn’t that bad, it’s like in Xbox when you do a moment in the last 30 seconds you can record it and your friends can see it. 30 seconds is pretty long actually. Hopefully Nintendo do something along the lines of posting it to your Nintendo account or something and can see it on your phone.
So Nintendo let's you record gameplay with the switch but if you post it to youtube they take all the revenue?  Nice.
Cool can I have normal voice chat now?
A few nitpicks:\n- 30 seconds is too short\n- YouTube should definitely be an option\n- Why 480p?\n- You should be able to record AFTER you press the button (maybe press the capture button & the d-pad at the same time?)\nI'm grateful for this feature, but it can definitely be improved on in the future
Capture a Nintendo video, post it to YouTube. Nintendo flags it, it's copyright material.\nWell lookit me. I'm a big dumb sucker! HA
30 seconds whoopee doo
this does not work
It would be better to capture at least one hour to make gameplays
30 seconds wow Nintendo is that the best you could do.....you could do better
Well lets all hope that Miiverse will come to the switch.
Dear Nintendo.I got some great ideas for the Nintendo switch updates!!!Can you guys please add a built in mic in the switch or allow any gaming headset to the switch instead of the awkward phone cables chat thing. voice chat would be easier. Also take off friend codes!it's annoying typing in codes just to get a friend. Also please don't make us pay to play online. And maybe add parties to the switch. parties are group of friends that can chat together. You can invite friends or allow friends of friends to join,also allow the host of the party to kick out others that are In the party. Last but not least allow players to stream on the Nintendo switch.
PS4 can record 1hr of footage. #NintendoStillSucks
Worst console ever made
Only 30 seconds seriously
Alright, let's clear something up. yes, each video can only be 30 seconds long, but I do believe it resets each time you save a recording, meaning you just have to hit the button every 30 seconds or less. Then some really simple video editing and you've got a nice lengthy video.\n\nNow onto the main deal here. It's meant to catch amazing moments in games so you can share it on Facebook or Twitter. Look at this cool thing I did that I was luckily able to record after I did it! It's an amazing thing to have! So don't complain when they try to do things we want. We all know you are happy to be able to record no matter how limited.
Just press the button every 30 seconds easy in splat2 cuz of the timer
They should make it so you hold screenshot button to start, then click it again to stop. But you can only record 15 to 20 minutes!
I'm going to CAPTURE myself CAPTURING an enemy in Super Mario Odyssey!
If only we can adjust the time of video
Would be better if it was a half hour.
30 seconds? I'm gonna end up with a lot of wasted memo- wait you can change the length? Nevermind. Good job Nintendo. You are better than Microsoft because of the fact that you don't force us to make a 30 second recording when we only needed 3.

Enough of the 2D boring pew pew games already! this is the future! where a massive open world like BOTW exists on SWITCH! Give me my Red Dead Redemption 2, My COD's and Battlefield's Nintendo! and I'll give you my mmmMONNEYYYYY.
You don't let anyone post so it's a useless function.
Why am I watching. I can't even afford a switch.
Find difference lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllLllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll if you find like please
Of course only 30 seconds. Don't want us making long video playthroughs. :/
how do we get this video's background music on the switch OS?
Almost as good as PS4's 60 minutes recording.\nAlmost.😝
Why only 30 seconds 😢
Nintendo never heard of the dark theme :(
Put Super Mario maker out for the switch 🙃🙃🙃
i could care less because it doesnt even post to youtube, but if they add a youtube option to editing and posting, that would be AWESOME.
I want the Nintendo switch!!! 😭
keep up the good work nintendo
Nintendo where is internet browser
I refuse to believe some of the people in the comment section are just that naïve. Its literally tells you its meant for highlights, people. Why am I seeing comments about capturing devices and streaming like it directly caters to and only to youtubers and so on, rather than someone out and about wanting capture a key moment on the go. I mean, as I recall, I do remember the Nintendo Switch being marketed as a device you can play and take anywhere, am I wrong?
why 30 second? 10-15 minutes is good but 30 second...
I thought it was gonna be like Playstation Screenshare. Oh well. :(
The reason that it's only 30 seconds long is because the feature is meant to capture game moments. Remember when Xbox introduced that feature by saying Xbox record that? Nintendo is basically doing the same thing. Ppl in the comments are saying they want full on YouTube video length recording features and that's not what Nintendo intended for the feature.
Im still waiting for super monkey ball 3 for the gamecube that was announced at E3 when the gamecube was out....smh im still waiting
See, now you just have to stop copyright striking us!

why 30 secs wtf nintendo :(
This is cool but to be honest it's useless nobodies going to use it for twitter or Facebook people only would want it for YouTube and if it was longer than 30 seconds
this does not work
It would be better to capture at least one hour to make gameplays
30 seconds wow Nintendo is that the best you could do.....you could do better
This is truly a fantastic feature!
TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT’S “ONLY THIRTY SECONDS”\nThis feature is meant for small clips or highlights of games. You should use this for when you do something cool that you wanna show your friends, like a triple kill in Spla2n or some really nice scenery in BoTW, and who knows they might increase it from 30 seconds to a couple of minutes. So just be patient, and be grateful with what you have now. (but lol i don’t think all the whiny kids don’t understand what “patience” or “gratefulness” is)
I DONT HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA!!!
Alright, let's clear something up. yes, each video can only be 30 seconds long, but I do believe it resets each time you save a recording, meaning you just have to hit the button every 30 seconds or less.

So Nintendo let's you record gameplay with the switch but if you post it to youtube they take all the revenue?  Nice.
You have to pay for multiplayer ewww...  pass.
Since you can't upload to gameplay to Youtube then why are you showing us this on YouTube? Nintendo is such a hypocrite
Worst console ever made
Does this mean you wont take peoples money from posting gameplay videos or nah
Add the virtual console ALREADY!!!
Cool can I have normal voice chat now?
A few nitpicks:\n- 30 seconds is too short\n- YouTube should definitely be an option\n- Why 480p?\n- You should be able to record AFTER you press the button (maybe press the capture button & the d-pad at the same time?)\nI'm grateful for this feature, but it can definitely be improved on in the future
30 seconds whoopee doo
This is cool but to be honest it's useless nobodies going to use it for twitter or Facebook people only would want it for YouTube and if it was longer than 30 seconds
I still want pokémon icons on the switch.  Please Nintendo actually listen to a fan this time or I'll hack my switch to have them and find an exploit to get unbanned.
