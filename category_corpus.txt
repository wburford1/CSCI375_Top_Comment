Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
Yes! Tomorrow night! 😊
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.
feeling good on a wednesday
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED

I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack.
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run.
Did they get the Bee?
Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again
Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!!
Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day?
Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today....
every time they say bee it duplicates the video
Does Randy have great temples?
Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now?
I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes.....
Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny.
😊Watch my YouTube videos😊
Why is this trending?
I'll get it LMAO
Stupid Trump supporters.😂😂😂
THEY DERK ER DERBS!!!
THE TOOK UER JEEEb!!
DEY TOOK AR JABS!!
Orgasmoooooooooooooos
Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit
I member ☺
I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011
What seems to be the officer, problem?
I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it
Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class).
Awesome.
Chief, no!
They took dur durrr
amazing work!
DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS
Can't wait!
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees
Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better
Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct?
Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump.
trump commits suicide after south park premiere
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates.
Trumptards
That reference though lol
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
(((South Park)))
LMAO WHITE TRASH
R.I.P. South Park.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Learn the truth about Charlottesville.
I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD
The Alt Right is the future!
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
It's started
Derk a Derrrr
dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
Day tooker jabbsss
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!

Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere

Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air

Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Or, how about a Stan/Wendy storyline, when he accidentally gets her pregnant.
R.I.P. South Park.
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\n\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\n\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\n\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\n\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\n\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\n\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\n\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\n\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\n\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\n\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.
Hey Alexa\n\n\n\n\nYEW WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!
One town, one relation! Death to mechanization!
🐸💥🔫 Alt right gotta take this L
I was disappointed. Im going to watch it again, to seal my disappointment with the episode, im going to add a layer of philosophy to it witch i probably didn't see amd isn't really their to digest it differently in hopes to find humorous meaning that may not really be there. </3 They should've either stopped at season 17 or stopped making them run together like a bigger longer cut.\n\ntl;dr this episode was disappointing.
Lol I love all the references to HGTV, especially Fixer Upper. xD\nI don't think lots of people really got it in the comments.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!

You have to watch this episode with your Alexa and laugh your ass off like I did...It's hilarious!!!!!
Alexa add titty chips to my shopping list LOL
So uh, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I've been glued to this show for (amazingly) 21 years now and this was the only episode I've ever seen that had nothing funny in it. Maybe Jim Bob, but that's fucking it.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D

Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo

DER TERK ER JERB
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
DEDER JEBS
South park makes fun of how stupid humanity is. Which means most of the people who like south park are the ones getting made fun of. So why do y'all like it if y'all see haw retarded it makes y'all look.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
feeling good on a wednesday
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Day tooker jabbsss
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
The creators are chickenshit. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this reverse racism bullshit. But, these two won't touch Muhammad, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
DurkEee DURRRR\nTUKRrr JaRBSS
This episode was so weak.
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
horrible horrible horrible episode.\nwow South Park wtf.\nwtf. wtf. wtf. wtf. why why why are you making your show shit now. it used to be great and now it sucks balls with this first episode. this is the best you could come up with??!? \nwowwww woww oowwowoeifjdjhdkfjsmfidnekdfucksouthparknowwtf
political randy episode\nsigh
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
(S)ALT RIGHT
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
shit episode
*CUCKED*\n*U*\n*C*\n*K*\n*E*\n*D*
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
Why won't they bring back chef...there are so many people that can do that voice spot on, just hire one
Alt-right nazis tears tastes so good...hmmm
R.I.P. South Park.
Idk this episode wasnt that funny.
Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air
Waited, watched and now disappointed.. South Park is dying.. Worst episode ever.
Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
Yes! Tomorrow night! 😊
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.
feeling good on a wednesday
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park

Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack.
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run.
Did they get the Bee?
Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again
Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!!
Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day?
Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today....
every time they say bee it duplicates the video
Does Randy have great temples?
Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now?
I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes.....
Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny.
😊Watch my YouTube videos😊
Why is this trending?
I'll get it LMAO
Stupid Trump supporters.😂😂😂
THEY DERK ER DERBS!!!
THE TOOK UER JEEEb!!
DEY TOOK AR JABS!!
Orgasmoooooooooooooos
Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit
I member ☺
I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011
What seems to be the officer, problem?
I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it
Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class).
Awesome.
Chief, no!
They took dur durrr
amazing work!
DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS
Can't wait!
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees
Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better
Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct?
Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump.
trump commits suicide after south park premiere
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates.
Trumptards
That reference though lol
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
(((South Park)))
LMAO WHITE TRASH
R.I.P. South Park.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Learn the truth about Charlottesville.
I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD
The Alt Right is the future!
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!

After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\n\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\n\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\n\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\n\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\n\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\n\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\n\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\n\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\n\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\n\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.
Hey Alexa\n\n\n\n\nYEW WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!
One town, one relation! Death to mechanization!
🐸💥🔫 Alt right gotta take this L
I was disappointed. Im going to watch it again, to seal my disappointment with the episode, im going to add a layer of philosophy to it witch i probably didn't see amd isn't really their to digest it differently in hopes to find humorous meaning that may not really be there. </3 They should've either stopped at season 17 or stopped making them run together like a bigger longer cut.\n\ntl;dr this episode was disappointing.
Lol I love all the references to HGTV, especially Fixer Upper. xD\nI don't think lots of people really got it in the comments.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!
this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT!
Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere
Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
You have to watch this episode with your Alexa and laugh your ass off like I did...It's hilarious!!!!!
Alexa add titty chips to my shopping list LOL
So uh, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I've been glued to this show for (amazingly) 21 years now and this was the only episode I've ever seen that had nothing funny in it. Maybe Jim Bob, but that's fucking it.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
This show is hilarious
(((South Park)))
It's started
Derk a Derrrr
dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb
Perfect
THEY TOOK OUR JOBS!
yeah bees in winter
TEY TOOK UR JEEEWBSSS
DEY TUK ER JERBS!!!!!!!!
I l southpar
OHH MYY FUUUCKING GOD ITS BACK! <3
YEAH TIP ASSIST
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
YES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASURE. THANK YOU MAT TREY
HAHAHAHA
nice 2 second clip guys.
Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!
DER TERK ER JERB
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
DEDER JEBS
South park makes fun of how stupid humanity is. Which means most of the people who like south park are the ones getting made fun of. So why do y'all like it if y'all see haw retarded it makes y'all look.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
feeling good on a wednesday
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Day tooker jabbsss
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
The creators are chickenshit. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this reverse racism bullshit. But, these two won't touch Muhammad, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
DurkEee DURRRR\nTUKRrr JaRBSS
This episode was so weak.
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
horrible horrible horrible episode.\nwow South Park wtf.\nwtf. wtf. wtf. wtf. why why why are you making your show shit now. it used to be great and now it sucks balls with this first episode. this is the best you could come up with??!? \nwowwww woww oowwowoeifjdjhdkfjsmfidnekdfucksouthparknowwtf
political randy episode\nsigh
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
(S)ALT RIGHT
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
shit episode
*CUCKED*\n*U*\n*C*\n*K*\n*E*\n*D*
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
Why won't they bring back chef...there are so many people that can do that voice spot on, just hire one
Alt-right nazis tears tastes so good...hmmm
R.I.P. South Park.
Idk this episode wasnt that funny.
Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air
Waited, watched and now disappointed.. South Park is dying.. Worst episode ever.
Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! No fucking way... How?! I mean... HOW?!
If Bethesda wants to gain popularity from nintendo fans...\n\n\n\n\n....they're succeeding.
This is massive.\n\nBethesda putting other 3rd parties on notice! Lol
And Bethesda again shows itself to be better than E.A
Wow Nintendo nice call
I have the weirdest Boner right now
Hell yeah, thank you id software and Nintendo.
Bethesda is one of the best allies helping   the Switch if other game developer give it more of a chance Switch will be way more successful. (Now here come the hate comments).
Holy shit, this is big, this is fucking Huge!!!
first time i saw this in direct\n\n\nme:WAIT WHAT
Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.
haill to bethesda now wee need fallout 4
Amazing move from Nintendo!!!!
Never expected this
Can we collect amiibos instead of the pop vinyls in doom for the switch?
Vulkan API Boyz!!!!
Fuck playing Doom and Wolfenstein on the go will be so sick
I guess Doom CAN run on anything...huh..
Where did this boner come from
My PC can max out these games but I want the portability, so I'll be buying them for Switch.
Now we're talking!
Did they hire that guy from Polygon to play this build too?
Fucking Doom wasn't expecting that, will buy
Now if only we could get Deus Ex Human Revolution on this thing. Don't feel like getting a Wii U to play that version of the game.\nEDIT: NVM, I take it back, I just remembered the Switch doesn't have Dual Screen functionality.
Switch underpowered umm nope...
The haters are going rage hater mode with this
look like it's time to kill demons and Nazi on the go!!!
Wait, what?
and fifa switch is a fifa 18 ps3 port...
Kinda bummed that the Switch version of Doom won't be getting Snapmap. I'm probably one of those weirdos who really loved the idea of map building on the go.
If we get the next elder scrolls for switch, I would fucking bend the knee to Bethesda
Instead of porting old good games, nintendo is going to burn it self with new games that would barely run on it.\nIf Switch could run CS:GO and BF BC 2 on it with a decent multiplayer, their sells would be sky rocketing.
it's gonna be a weird feeling when the kkk and nazi's are on my switch.
I hope that the scenes they showed are switch footage (but it's probably not)
Time for me to cancel my Wolfenstein PS4 pre-order...
Looks like it's time to buy a lot more memory cards since the Switch has the same hard drive space as a Gameboy
Playing proper Doom while on a bus... that sounds fucking good.
I am not at all trying to sound greedy because this is freaking insane, CAN WE PLEASE GET DISHONORED 2 ON SWITCH?!?!?!
Swastika in a Nintendo Direct? *TRIGGERED*\n\nAll seriousness,  I'm glad Nintendo grew up.
Lets just wait and see if the game actually runs on anything higher than 480p 25fps before we collectively suck Nintendos dick!!!
Yay I can play the games I can never play cause I didn't have the right console
If switch gets doom\n\nOverwatch is a must now.
Is it just me or this smells like fucking downgrade?
looks blurry af tho :/ hope it will be 60fps at least
I can play Doom sitting on the toilet, in my bed, on the bus, in the sewers, on a tree, chilling in a hot bath,
Nice, but it won't sell well. Nintendo needs 3rd party games released on their system either exclusively or at the very least on the same day as the other platforms.
I wonder if doom will run at 60fps. Because the game was designed to run at a solid 60fps and anything less just won't work in my opinion
teh switch has no hardcor gamsssss\nit babby consollllll\nit needs more schuuuut\n*wish gets granted, haters have nothing to complain about*\n....... the gaphics still sux\n*points out it runs on a handheld system*\n*hater cries*\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
XBOX IN 3RD PLACE NOW FOR SURE! SERVES THEM RIGHT THO HAHAHA
I hope people support this, I have DOOM for the PC and it was an incredible experience.  And now that Wolfenstein 2 is coming to the Switch, I might pick it up for that instead of the PC.  Nice one Nintendo!
Gey fucking in there... never got the chance to play doom
I'm cool with some DooM on the go.
I'm glad i didn't buy doom last year. now ill be able to play the best version of the game and I'm really excited to buy and play this.
If you don't have a true understanding of the switches power. Just save your ignorant comments. The switch is slot stronger than alot of you realize.
I never thought Id hear this guy say Nazi
I could get the graphically superior versions on PS4 but I'm getting both of these on Switch.  Portability > Graphics
will those two games be running on 20 fps?
Can you run doom on a machine equal to a xbox 360/ps3??????(the switch)....can it even properly run it with frame rate problems???? And a 32 gb harddrive????? No, you can't....iphones even have 64/128 gb....32 is it????? Thats it????
Watch cod 2018 be on switch.  I'm calling it
Nice announcement ! one thing i noticed is that the downgrade is huge, if they keep the 60 fps stable it will still be a blast to play regardless of the visual quality.
Did honestly never see this comming.\nI think i just came a little bit...
OMG YES! DOOM ON THE SWITCH!
Yay, Doom on low settings and 30 FPS.
Nazis?  In my Nintendo?
This is really a surprise, i don't know how a system wich can't run Overcooked at 30fps will be able to run DOOM on the go... Maybe it's a custom built, or those Switch are gonna melt for sure
Delet this
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
yoooo
wow, megaton announcement :o speaking of which....  fallout 3 plx?
damn the resolution looks sub 720p...
🎶bandz make Nintendo dance baybeeee🎶
Iconic:v
Damn
Holy shit man!!!
WHOO!!! 🤘😆
Fuckin hell yeah
NAAAAAAAANIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Thats incredible
OMG WTF DUDE THIS SHIT IS DOPE !
Noice
me Sorprende que lo pueda correr en la Nintendo switch
Well look at that. Nintendo says the word Nazi and shows the Swastika and the world didn't end. Man fuck these developers and their infantile pandering to the dumbest people on Earth.
low settings 720p 60fps im fine with it just 60fps pleaseeeeee
It the switch can run it, I'd like to see it for Android/iOS soon too
bad quality for nintendo switch\npd: better in pas4 and xbox one\npd: much better in PC Master Race
Older nvidia shield tablet which is less powerfull(half the ram etc) can run crysis 3 on android so surely switch can run about anything on a fixed platform. Super exited gonna buy both! Allready played doom on powerfull pc but gameplay over the graphics and take it on the go muchnwow!1
Doom's online mode is dead : /
Bruh, First Skyrim , then Doom and Wolfenstein, now I belive anything is possible. What's next? Fallout 4?!
Can doom even run 60 fps on the switch?
Yeah, because the Switch can totally run these.\nGuys I was joking, please stop replying !
30fps lol
xbox crossplay, please
AND THEY'VE LISTENED! DECENT THIRD PARTY SUPPORT! THANK FUCK! Took their time since the SNES era though!
So we can expect to run like shit in that shitty console, so why are the nintytards excited?
Nice now I can play the games I already owned at 240p and 15 fps.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! No fucking way... How?! I mean... HOW?!

Wait, what?

Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
Yes! Tomorrow night! 😊
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck

I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.

Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D

I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack.
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run.
Did they get the Bee?
Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again
Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!!
Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day?
Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today....
every time they say bee it duplicates the video
Does Randy have great temples?
Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now?
I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes.....
Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny.
😊Watch my YouTube videos😊

I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011
What seems to be the officer, problem?
I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it
Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class).
Awesome.
Chief, no!
They took dur durrr
amazing work!
DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS
Can't wait!
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees
Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better
Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct?
Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump.
trump commits suicide after south park premiere
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates.
Trumptards
That reference though lol
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
(((South Park)))
LMAO WHITE TRASH
R.I.P. South Park.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Learn the truth about Charlottesville.
I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD
The Alt Right is the future!
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
It's started
Derk a Derrrr
dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
Day tooker jabbsss
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!
this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT!
Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere
Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
YES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASURE. THANK YOU MAT TREY
HAHAHAHA
nice 2 second clip guys.
Perfect
THEY TOOK OUR JOBS!

OHH MYY FUUUCKING GOD ITS BACK! <3
YEAH TIP ASSIST
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!

Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air

Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Or, how about a Stan/Wendy storyline, when he accidentally gets her pregnant.
R.I.P. South Park.
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\n\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\n\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\n\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\n\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\n\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\n\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\n\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\n\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\n\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\n\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.
Hey Alexa\n\n\n\n\nYEW WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!
One town, one relation! Death to mechanization!
🐸💥🔫 Alt right gotta take this L
I was disappointed. Im going to watch it again, to seal my disappointment with the episode, im going to add a layer of philosophy to it witch i probably didn't see amd isn't really their to digest it differently in hopes to find humorous meaning that may not really be there. </3 They should've either stopped at season 17 or stopped making them run together like a bigger longer cut.\n\ntl;dr this episode was disappointing.
Lol I love all the references to HGTV, especially Fixer Upper. xD\nI don't think lots of people really got it in the comments.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again

You have to watch this episode with your Alexa and laugh your ass off like I did...It's hilarious!!!!!
Alexa add titty chips to my shopping list LOL
So uh, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I've been glued to this show for (amazingly) 21 years now and this was the only episode I've ever seen that had nothing funny in it. Maybe Jim Bob, but that's fucking it.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!

Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.
haill to bethesda now wee need fallout 4
Amazing move from Nintendo!!!!
Never expected this
Can we collect amiibos instead of the pop vinyls in doom for the switch?
Vulkan API Boyz!!!!
Fuck playing Doom and Wolfenstein on the go will be so sick
I guess Doom CAN run on anything...huh..
Where did this boner come from
My PC can max out these games but I want the portability, so I'll be buying them for Switch.
Now we're talking!
Did they hire that guy from Polygon to play this build too?
Fucking Doom wasn't expecting that, will buy
Now if only we could get Deus Ex Human Revolution on this thing. Don't feel like getting a Wii U to play that version of the game.\nEDIT: NVM, I take it back, I just remembered the Switch doesn't have Dual Screen functionality.
Switch underpowered umm nope...
The haters are going rage hater mode with this
look like it's time to kill demons and Nazi on the go!!!
Wait, what?
and fifa switch is a fifa 18 ps3 port...
Kinda bummed that the Switch version of Doom won't be getting Snapmap. I'm probably one of those weirdos who really loved the idea of map building on the go.
If we get the next elder scrolls for switch, I would fucking bend the knee to Bethesda
Instead of porting old good games, nintendo is going to burn it self with new games that would barely run on it.\nIf Switch could run CS:GO and BF BC 2 on it with a decent multiplayer, their sells would be sky rocketing.
it's gonna be a weird feeling when the kkk and nazi's are on my switch.
I hope that the scenes they showed are switch footage (but it's probably not)
Time for me to cancel my Wolfenstein PS4 pre-order...
Looks like it's time to buy a lot more memory cards since the Switch has the same hard drive space as a Gameboy
Playing proper Doom while on a bus... that sounds fucking good.
I am not at all trying to sound greedy because this is freaking insane, CAN WE PLEASE GET DISHONORED 2 ON SWITCH?!?!?!
Swastika in a Nintendo Direct? *TRIGGERED*\n\nAll seriousness,  I'm glad Nintendo grew up.
Lets just wait and see if the game actually runs on anything higher than 480p 25fps before we collectively suck Nintendos dick!!!
Yay I can play the games I can never play cause I didn't have the right console
If switch gets doom\n\nOverwatch is a must now.
Is it just me or this smells like fucking downgrade?
looks blurry af tho :/ hope it will be 60fps at least
I can play Doom sitting on the toilet, in my bed, on the bus, in the sewers, on a tree, chilling in a hot bath,
Nice, but it won't sell well. Nintendo needs 3rd party games released on their system either exclusively or at the very least on the same day as the other platforms.
I wonder if doom will run at 60fps. Because the game was designed to run at a solid 60fps and anything less just won't work in my opinion
teh switch has no hardcor gamsssss\nit babby consollllll\nit needs more schuuuut\n*wish gets granted, haters have nothing to complain about*\n....... the gaphics still sux\n*points out it runs on a handheld system*\n*hater cries*\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
XBOX IN 3RD PLACE NOW FOR SURE! SERVES THEM RIGHT THO HAHAHA
I hope people support this, I have DOOM for the PC and it was an incredible experience.  And now that Wolfenstein 2 is coming to the Switch, I might pick it up for that instead of the PC.  Nice one Nintendo!
Gey fucking in there... never got the chance to play doom
I'm cool with some DooM on the go.
I'm glad i didn't buy doom last year. now ill be able to play the best version of the game and I'm really excited to buy and play this.
If you don't have a true understanding of the switches power. Just save your ignorant comments. The switch is slot stronger than alot of you realize.
I never thought Id hear this guy say Nazi
I could get the graphically superior versions on PS4 but I'm getting both of these on Switch.  Portability > Graphics
will those two games be running on 20 fps?
Can you run doom on a machine equal to a xbox 360/ps3??????(the switch)....can it even properly run it with frame rate problems???? And a 32 gb harddrive????? No, you can't....iphones even have 64/128 gb....32 is it????? Thats it????
Watch cod 2018 be on switch.  I'm calling it
Nice announcement ! one thing i noticed is that the downgrade is huge, if they keep the 60 fps stable it will still be a blast to play regardless of the visual quality.
Did honestly never see this comming.\nI think i just came a little bit...
OMG YES! DOOM ON THE SWITCH!
Yay, Doom on low settings and 30 FPS.
Nazis?  In my Nintendo?
This is really a surprise, i don't know how a system wich can't run Overcooked at 30fps will be able to run DOOM on the go... Maybe it's a custom built, or those Switch are gonna melt for sure
Delet this
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
yoooo
wow, megaton announcement :o speaking of which....  fallout 3 plx?
damn the resolution looks sub 720p...
🎶bandz make Nintendo dance baybeeee🎶
Iconic:v
Damn
Holy shit man!!!
WHOO!!! 🤘😆
Fuckin hell yeah
NAAAAAAAANIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Thats incredible
OMG WTF DUDE THIS SHIT IS DOPE !
Noice
me Sorprende que lo pueda correr en la Nintendo switch
Well look at that. Nintendo says the word Nazi and shows the Swastika and the world didn't end. Man fuck these developers and their infantile pandering to the dumbest people on Earth.
low settings 720p 60fps im fine with it just 60fps pleaseeeeee
It the switch can run it, I'd like to see it for Android/iOS soon too
bad quality for nintendo switch\npd: better in pas4 and xbox one\npd: much better in PC Master Race
Older nvidia shield tablet which is less powerfull(half the ram etc) can run crysis 3 on android so surely switch can run about anything on a fixed platform. Super exited gonna buy both! Allready played doom on powerfull pc but gameplay over the graphics and take it on the go muchnwow!1
Doom's online mode is dead : /
Bruh, First Skyrim , then Doom and Wolfenstein, now I belive anything is possible. What's next? Fallout 4?!
Can doom even run 60 fps on the switch?
Yeah, because the Switch can totally run these.\nGuys I was joking, please stop replying !
30fps lol
xbox crossplay, please
AND THEY'VE LISTENED! DECENT THIRD PARTY SUPPORT! THANK FUCK! Took their time since the SNES era though!
So we can expect to run like shit in that shitty console, so why are the nintytards excited?
Nice now I can play the games I already owned at 240p and 15 fps.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! No fucking way... How?! I mean... HOW?!
If Bethesda wants to gain popularity from nintendo fans...\n\n\n\n\n....they're succeeding.
This is massive.\n\nBethesda putting other 3rd parties on notice! Lol
And Bethesda again shows itself to be better than E.A
Wow Nintendo nice call
Bethesda is one of the best allies helping   the Switch if other game developer give it more of a chance Switch will be way more successful. (Now here come the hate comments).
I have the weirdest Boner right now
Hell yeah, thank you id software and Nintendo.
Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.

Wait, what?

Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
Yes! Tomorrow night! 😊
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them.
feeling good on a wednesday
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED
TEY TOOK UR JEEEWBSSS
DEY TUK ER JERBS!!!!!!!!
I l southpar
OHH MYY FUUUCKING GOD ITS BACK! <3
YEAH TIP ASSIST
YES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASURE. THANK YOU MAT TREY
HAHAHAHA
nice 2 second clip guys.
Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!
DER TERK ER JERB
I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack.
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run.
Did they get the Bee?
Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again
Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!!
Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day?
Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today....
every time they say bee it duplicates the video
Does Randy have great temples?
Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now?
I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes.....
Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny.
😊Watch my YouTube videos😊
Why is this trending?
I'll get it LMAO
Stupid Trump supporters.😂😂😂
THEY DERK ER DERBS!!!
THE TOOK UER JEEEb!!
DEY TOOK AR JABS!!
Orgasmoooooooooooooos
Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit
I member ☺
I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011
What seems to be the officer, problem?
I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it
Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class).
Awesome.
Chief, no!
They took dur durrr
amazing work!
DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS
Can't wait!
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees
Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better
Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct?
Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump.
trump commits suicide after south park premiere
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates.
Trumptards
That reference though lol
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
(((South Park)))
LMAO WHITE TRASH
R.I.P. South Park.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Learn the truth about Charlottesville.
I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD
The Alt Right is the future!
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show.
If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
It's started
Derk a Derrrr
dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
Day tooker jabbsss
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
they took your job

Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!
this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT!
Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere
Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.

JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.
South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode.
If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school.
Was that Master Chief at 0:05?!
They will fuck it up same way some how
This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season.
OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone
My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today
Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :)))
Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!

Orgasmoooooooooooooos
Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit
I member ☺
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back.
Long Live the Confederacy
first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience!
The Alt Right is the future!
Stupid Trump supporters.😂😂😂
Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air
These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..
Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in.
That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority!
Or, how about a Stan/Wendy storyline, when he accidentally gets her pregnant.
R.I.P. South Park.
Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original
So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals
After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.
The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.
This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\n\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\n\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\n\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\n\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\n\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\n\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\n\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\n\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\n\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\n\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.
Hey Alexa\n\n\n\n\nYEW WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!
One town, one relation! Death to mechanization!
🐸💥🔫 Alt right gotta take this L
I was disappointed. Im going to watch it again, to seal my disappointment with the episode, im going to add a layer of philosophy to it witch i probably didn't see amd isn't really their to digest it differently in hopes to find humorous meaning that may not really be there. </3 They should've either stopped at season 17 or stopped making them run together like a bigger longer cut.\n\ntl;dr this episode was disappointing.
Lol I love all the references to HGTV, especially Fixer Upper. xD\nI don't think lots of people really got it in the comments.
Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though.
Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode
Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great
I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast.
All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so
I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again
Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though!
this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT!
Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere
Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About
Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.
i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase.
You have to watch this episode with your Alexa and laugh your ass off like I did...It's hilarious!!!!!
Alexa add titty chips to my shopping list LOL
So uh, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I've been glued to this show for (amazingly) 21 years now and this was the only episode I've ever seen that had nothing funny in it. Maybe Jim Bob, but that's fucking it.
Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait!
I've been waiting for this forever
Will the new episode be on Hulu?
High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D
There's a bee in here!
they took your job
Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck.
Shit like this is why I love South Park
Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo
This is going to be awesome.
The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :)
Please make a mockery of antifa to
I've missed South Park
GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED
King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D
Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year.

Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss!
DER TERK ER JERB
Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you.
0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head?
i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream
Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this.
Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman
DEDER JEBS
South park makes fun of how stupid humanity is. Which means most of the people who like south park are the ones getting made fun of. So why do y'all like it if y'all see haw retarded it makes y'all look.
Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck
tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie
I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing.
feeling good on a wednesday
STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER.
As retarded as this show is, I still love it.
Day tooker jabbsss
Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!!
THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS!
The creators are chickenshit. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this reverse racism bullshit. But, these two won't touch Muhammad, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is.
DurkEee DURRRR\nTUKRrr JaRBSS
This episode was so weak.
I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous
horrible horrible horrible episode.\nwow South Park wtf.\nwtf. wtf. wtf. wtf. why why why are you making your show shit now. it used to be great and now it sucks balls with this first episode. this is the best you could come up with??!? \nwowwww woww oowwowoeifjdjhdkfjsmfidnekdfucksouthparknowwtf
political randy episode\nsigh
Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda.
(S)ALT RIGHT
When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now
Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy.
shit episode
*CUCKED*\n*U*\n*C*\n*K*\n*E*\n*D*

Why won't they bring back chef...there are so many people that can do that voice spot on, just hire one
Alt-right nazis tears tastes so good...hmmm
R.I.P. South Park.
Idk this episode wasnt that funny.
Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air
Waited, watched and now disappointed.. South Park is dying.. Worst episode ever.
Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad..

Life is unfair!

He's so humble & cute. I'm glad he's proud of his childhood acting. Most child stars are so bitter.
He looks almost EXACTLY THE SAME! Oh my god!
Omg he seems SO genuine and nice!
I thought Malcolm would run for president now
The song and his personality came together very beautifully. He was very humble and the whole thing was very touching.  His musicality was excellent and his frame and posture were vey good, they kept body contact during the whole dance. However,  there were no heel leads, When he stepped back he didn't glide on the floor, there was almost no sway and his arms were really stiff. It was a beautiful, lyrical, touching foxtrot but technically it was weak. a 6 from me.
I enjoyed this performance.
I freaking love Frankie! \nYou know some people are like, 'Don't call me Carlton..' 😂😂😂😂😂
Frankie Muniz is the man! I hope he wins he's always been a cool guy and never let the fame go to his head
I want him to win.
i see a male contender 👏👌
 you know call me Malcolm I'll probably respond  😂😂😂
It's cute seeing him so shy 😂
Whitney is 23, Frankie is 31... seriously doubt her dad is same age!   LOL        LOVE Frankie!!!!!!    So humble!
Frankie looks amazing!
Whitney got ass
where's reese
Life is unfair!
He's good!
That was beautiful I love him
0:37 malcom still breaking the 4th wall after all these years. XD
Wow all they gave was a 6 shit they cheap i think he did atleast a 23
He is so handsome
He is just the most adorable thing lol he seems super cool to be around which is awesome to know that someone from one of my favorite shows is super cool haha
Cody Banks...ok.
I loved Frankie when I was younger he was always my fav actor to watch now I'm 16 about to be 17 in a month and I still remember him as my first crush and he danced to Harry's song now I'm honestly going to die a happy girl😂❤️
Loooooved this dance!!!  What a surprise! Loved it ❤️
What nonsense that score they gave him was trash!!! He should have gotten more than that😡😡
I ship them!!❤
What's the name of the song they are dancing to? Thanks!
Agent Cody Banks, Lizzie McGuire guest appearance and Big Fat Liar. Always on an adventure it seems.
i do like his humility, I like his sincerity, not pompous at all :)
Awww so cute, love him
I thought frankie was dead?
Frankie bears a strong resemblance to joe montana.just add some curly locks.
He seems like a nice relate-able guy. Hope he does well!
Did he stumble at 1:48? It looked like they tripped over each other's feet
I was watching others performances to see if they were going to use any of Harrys song and I literally screamed when SOTT came on. \n\np.s. I also watched the other performances to rate them not just because of Harry
He could be good, but I think he needs to widen his arms movment and slow them down, to make the movment look more gracious...
He is so sweet omg.
I love him 💟Frankie
What a sweet, humble guy - I wasn't expecting him to be like that. I hope he grows through this and does really well.
he's so cute!!  been a huge fan of his for years, so they got my votes.
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
How the hell is Frankie old enough to be her dad?\nOr was she just kidding?\nB/c, like, he's 31, which is younger than my parents were when I was born.
He's good! I'll vote for him
Frankie Muniz is always been one of my favorite actors. I was really sad that he retired so early. I'm very glad to see his return
Malcom in the middle class.
also in what world is 480p hd
Malcome ....awkward......

2:10 OH MY GOD!!! I've never seen that side of her!! It feels weird, but I'm glad she's having fun and trying new things!! :D
Voted Lindsay & Mark!!! I want them to win sooooo bad!!!!
Im so proud of her!!!!!! Omg i cant even process!!🔥🔥🔥😘❤️💕💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
That footwork has me shook
Len obviously never saw any of her stage performances if he wasn't expecting her high level of foot movement.  She has invented many of her own dance moves and steps on stage and incorporated Celtic dance in many of her choreography.
I haven't watched DWTS since the first few seasons but I've come to watch Lindsey!
I'm so proud of her! I remember when she auditioned for AGT!
just saw that jimmy kimmel picked derek fisher to win----don't think so!!---lindsey and mark to win!!!
this is such a creative pair, and I really enjoy that she seems to inspire Mark to bring out his A-game
Love her hope she goes far
2:18 this part was the best of this dance show , she was so perfect
Amazing 💛 I'm calling it! Either she wins or she's a finalist!
She's really good!
How about the NIKKI Bella oneeee
I'm for her !
And then they fucked.  And it got awkward.
UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE! Lindsey is so talented it blows my mind!!!!
thank god with that 46,000 views that it's on the trending page. how much does youtube charge to go on the trending page?
Derek Hough was in her video The Arena
Lindsey Stirling and Jordan Fisher are the only reasons I will be watching this season. Top 2 anyone?
WOW ! Luv her music, but DANG ! Great 1st dance ! Choreography,  chemistry, sharp, on rhythm and they both looked like they were having fun.
I love her! She is my biggest inspiration in music and all things in life! ♥
I honestly had no clue which person was the professional dancer and who wasn't 💃 🕺🏽🙌
They killed it yesterday! 1:14 XD
The Dance The Music and The Couple just PERFECT Yes!!
I've seen her do spins..I knew she had it
Lindsey rocked it. She's a contender! Awesome lady amazing talent
one of the best dances by far
These two are going to go far
Can you upload Nikki's dance?
She's so bubbly I love her!!
HD yeah right !!..>.<.. 480p rubbish, this need to be 1080p -_-
Woohoo Lindsey!!!! You r my inspiration!!!! I expected nothing less of you!!! You danced the night away! Bless you for round 2!!! ^-^
Omgod Lindsey.  She already won.  I love her! She has to win all the way.
WOW!! What a way to finish the night ! It was, without any doubt, the best dance of the night. She showed lots of natural ability, impeccable musicality and great personality. Mark's choreography was very,very intricate and she handled it amazingly. She really felt the rhythm of the music, it was gorgeous. Haven't said that, she does need to work on her arms (they were a bit bizarre) and her forward lock-step wasn't good, technically speaking, but overall it was amazing. An 8 from me.
She's sooo perfect !  Love her so much **^** my queen  <3
Love Lindsey! I hope she continues to do well and she makes it to the end. Mark and Lindsey seem like a great combo!
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much Media Galactic! #teamstark

just saw that jimmy kimmel picked derek fisher to win----don't think so!!---lindsey and mark to win!!!
this is such a creative pair, and I really enjoy that she seems to inspire Mark to bring out his A-game
Love her hope she goes far
WOW!! What a way to finish the night ! It was, without any doubt, the best dance of the night. She showed lots of natural ability, impeccable musicality and great personality. Mark's choreography was very,very intricate and she handled it amazingly. She really felt the rhythm of the music, it was gorgeous. Haven't said that, she does need to work on her arms (they were a bit bizarre) and her forward lock-step wasn't good, technically speaking, but overall it was amazing. An 8 from me.
2:18 this part was the best of this dance show , she was so perfect
Amazing 💛 I'm calling it! Either she wins or she's a finalist!
She's really good!
How about the NIKKI Bella oneeee
Omgod Lindsey.  She already won.  I love her! She has to win all the way.
She's sooo perfect !  Love her so much **^** my queen  <3
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much Media Galactic! #teamstark
I'm for her !
This makes me so happy!! I love when good things happen to good people! People shouldn't be shocked she's amazing!
you know dont you ,your in it to win it go girl
She has that sexy nerd thing going for her.
I haven’t watched the show in so long and have forgotten how tough these judges can be! They should have got 8s across the board.
So glad you uploaded this thank you!! Lindsey and Mark are my fav couple this year. Their chemistry is amazing and I know their choreography and costumes are going to blow us away this season. I am rooting for them to win!!!
thank god with that 46,000 views that it's on the trending page. how much does youtube charge to go on the trending page?
Derek Hough was in her video The Arena
WOW ! Luv her music, but DANG ! Great 1st dance ! Choreography,  chemistry, sharp, on rhythm and they both looked like they were having fun.
I love her! She is my biggest inspiration in music and all things in life! ♥
I honestly had no clue which person was the professional dancer and who wasn't 💃 🕺🏽🙌
They killed it yesterday! 1:14 XD
The Dance The Music and The Couple just PERFECT Yes!!
one of the best dances by far
These two are going to go far
UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE! Lindsey is so talented it blows my mind!!!!
Can you upload Nikki's dance?
She's so bubbly I love her!!
HD yeah right !!..>.<.. 480p rubbish, this need to be 1080p -_-
I've seen her do spins..I knew she had it
Lindsey rocked it. She's a contender! Awesome lady amazing talent
Woohoo Lindsey!!!! You r my inspiration!!!! I expected nothing less of you!!! You danced the night away! Bless you for round 2!!! ^-^
Love Lindsey! I hope she continues to do well and she makes it to the end. Mark and Lindsey seem like a great combo!
Pleaseeee
UNDERSCORED!!!

Lindsey is amazing !
Great!!---and only 7's from Carrie Ann and Bruno???  Hello???

It's between her and Jordan....  it Jordan will def win
I wish she was not in a cult. She is cute. The cult part is creepy.
hi, can you post the opening number?
And then they fucked.  And it got awkward.
song title pls
7's? Wtf do they give bad dances?

Lindsey Stirling and Jordan Fisher are the only reasons I will be watching this season. Top 2 anyone?
people from YouTube are considered stars now? must be running out of contestants...

Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
on my console it dont work :(
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
I can’t get it to work. Help?
I'm tearing up right here, legit
WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy

岩田「直接！」\n(iwata) (Choku setsu !)
Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
It doesnt work
Faked for views
Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.
This isn't working for me...
i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
I'm not a fan of mute videos.
did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.
Someone buy this buy a better camera.

Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.
Are you supposed to press any of the top shoulder buttons when you do this?
Wtf is this on trending

Top 10 Creepypasta Rituals
Oh yeah reaaaall cool guy,  😑
Stupid .  Why you no narrate
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Iwata almost ran Nintendo into the fucking ground
Nintendo was so afraid of losing money that they put the shittiest fucking golf game in it rather than something that's good, good on you Nintendo
Due to the overwhelming response to this video, I felt it appropriate to give an explanation.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkAvnnFICE&feature=youtu.be
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
As much as this is seems a tear jerker, its best to not open the program as it is a Omamori, per this twitter https://twitter.com/sprsk/status/910295200228032512?lang=en
I couldnt get it to work on my switch no matter how much I tried can anybody help me
I need to connect to the monitor and demonstrate it
I've tried this three times and no luck
One of the coolest things I've ever seen.
its not showing a thing there to allow me to change the system time and date
Do you get to keep the game, or is it only playable on July 11th?
That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')
How the fuck did you figure that out??
Goat fire brigade'  helps save Spain from forest fires\nhttps://youtu.be/ImFJAw2SnZg
I understood how the 3ds had all types of hidden games, but why would Nintendo make you summon a game?
Cool video paying your respects to him. 👍
i used to rock this game on my nes
Hey that's some pretty good asmr
thank you for posting this.
I did the exact same thing and yet i didnt get it
May I put forward a proposition; you shout me out, and I reciprocate (Do the same)
Oh man, I remember that game.
This is on trending
i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
I don't say this often for actions made by people, but this is beautiful...
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
success
Clickbait.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream

Get a pc
How did someone figure all of this out?
is it possible to do this without hacking your switch?
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I can’t get it to work. Help?
fucking moron can't speek? holy fuck wts is this? get cancer and die.
check.  out.    watch.     now.   \nshared.    my.      video.    2017.

This video was made on my friends birthday
Holy moly can you speak or not?
on my console it dont work :(
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.

If she doesn't win I will be shocked to say the least.
2:10 OH MY GOD!!! I've never seen that side of her!! It feels weird, but I'm glad she's having fun and trying new things!! :D
Voted Lindsay & Mark!!! I want them to win sooooo bad!!!!
Im so proud of her!!!!!! Omg i cant even process!!🔥🔥🔥😘❤️💕💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
That footwork has me shook
Len obviously never saw any of her stage performances if he wasn't expecting her high level of foot movement.  She has invented many of her own dance moves and steps on stage and incorporated Celtic dance in many of her choreography.
I haven't watched DWTS since the first few seasons but I've come to watch Lindsey!
I'm so proud of her! I remember when she auditioned for AGT!
just saw that jimmy kimmel picked derek fisher to win----don't think so!!---lindsey and mark to win!!!
this is such a creative pair, and I really enjoy that she seems to inspire Mark to bring out his A-game
Love her hope she goes far
2:18 this part was the best of this dance show , she was so perfect
Amazing 💛 I'm calling it! Either she wins or she's a finalist!
She's really good!
How about the NIKKI Bella oneeee
I'm for her !
And then they fucked.  And it got awkward.
UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE! Lindsey is so talented it blows my mind!!!!
thank god with that 46,000 views that it's on the trending page. how much does youtube charge to go on the trending page?
Derek Hough was in her video The Arena
Lindsey Stirling and Jordan Fisher are the only reasons I will be watching this season. Top 2 anyone?
WOW ! Luv her music, but DANG ! Great 1st dance ! Choreography,  chemistry, sharp, on rhythm and they both looked like they were having fun.
I love her! She is my biggest inspiration in music and all things in life! ♥
I honestly had no clue which person was the professional dancer and who wasn't 💃 🕺🏽🙌
They killed it yesterday! 1:14 XD
The Dance The Music and The Couple just PERFECT Yes!!
I've seen her do spins..I knew she had it
Lindsey rocked it. She's a contender! Awesome lady amazing talent
one of the best dances by far
These two are going to go far
Can you upload Nikki's dance?
She's so bubbly I love her!!
HD yeah right !!..>.<.. 480p rubbish, this need to be 1080p -_-
Woohoo Lindsey!!!! You r my inspiration!!!! I expected nothing less of you!!! You danced the night away! Bless you for round 2!!! ^-^
Omgod Lindsey.  She already won.  I love her! She has to win all the way.
WOW!! What a way to finish the night ! It was, without any doubt, the best dance of the night. She showed lots of natural ability, impeccable musicality and great personality. Mark's choreography was very,very intricate and she handled it amazingly. She really felt the rhythm of the music, it was gorgeous. Haven't said that, she does need to work on her arms (they were a bit bizarre) and her forward lock-step wasn't good, technically speaking, but overall it was amazing. An 8 from me.
She's sooo perfect !  Love her so much **^** my queen  <3
Love Lindsey! I hope she continues to do well and she makes it to the end. Mark and Lindsey seem like a great combo!
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much Media Galactic! #teamstark

She has that sexy nerd thing going for her.
I haven’t watched the show in so long and have forgotten how tough these judges can be! They should have got 8s across the board.
So glad you uploaded this thank you!! Lindsey and Mark are my fav couple this year. Their chemistry is amazing and I know their choreography and costumes are going to blow us away this season. I am rooting for them to win!!!

I feel like michael bay directed this
there i was ... hoping for a wehrmacht campain.
Still a few butthurt nerds over CoD WWII still having women and poc in the game because it's not historically accurate. So if you do some research, you'll find that in other countries, women served in combat, as well as poc in the U.S. They were separated but, still saw combat.
When they will finally do a new story line at the Eastern front, Norther region, Italy, Balkans, Egypt, Philippines and something involving other nations? It's called World War II for a reason, not American Hero Campaign 23!
Hey! That's pretty good!
Can someone give a name of the soundtrack?
Oy vey, this will be good!
I saw swastikas like if u saw them
no more wall jumping robots i'm happy yeeaahh i got motion sick on blops 3
How do people not know the difference between in game graphics and pre rendered cinematics at this point...
When graphics are better than real life
1:38 - 1:39\n\nDid you notice? When he hit him with the machine gun, he did not even touch him!
Daym... the graphics and the campaign is too nasty😍
2:01 this is what i like to see!
Best game war ever. T
I have a feeling that cod ww2 is gonna have a great and emotional campaign (probably) just like the one in cod waw
Shut up and take my money! ... Oh wait, they already did... Shut up and give me that game! :D
2017, cod retards are still falling for CGI xDDDDDDDDDDDDD Idiots, that's not CoD WW2 graphic, THESE ARE JUST CUTSCENES. Cod graphic will be 100 times worse like always.
Looks like the zombies and campaign will be better than the actual multiplayer
This Is What I've Been Waiting For!! So Hyped ❤️
tbh Bf1 campaign is so dull and too fast, i hope Cod Ww2 bring something new to me, my last cod is Aw
Get ready for grenade spam on veteran :)
no soviet union in CoD about WW2, gg
Game looks amazing a cod in recent years that I am Excited for.
You can win everyone \nPeople moan if it's future bullshit or they moan if it's in the past \nMake your Bloody mind up\nNo wonder Activision can't decide straight away what game to make as you half of the people wanting the opposite thing
this looks cool, but knowing call of duty, it's gonna be about 6 short and repetitive missions long
This better be good!
So we're not gonna be fighting Japan in this game?
I can't wait that game
Greece fought 2 its a shame that we didnt get even an honourable mention ;(
THIS looks like real life game
I SEE A SWASTIKA
i like m1 garand sound at the end
Wasn't expecting that, good job.
So psyched. Finally I can return to COD after years of considering the series a joke
Thats the cod been looking for .....
Wait for someone to get offended that there is no black soldiers...
man too bad new games costs so much I'd get this for the campaign, might play multiplayer a bit but mostly for the campaign
That's more like it. Now just get rid of microtransactions, quickscoping snipers, and pre-teen  squeakers in the multiplayer, and we have a winner.
Im more excited to play the campaign than multiplayer
Bf1 will be always better
Reminds me a lot of Band of Brothers.
this the real cod and not the future shits like last 3
trailer be like Christopher Nolan and the game be like Michael bay.
When will the time travellers come in and give the US the exo suits
Should be a movie
I thought this video has age limitation, but why theres still some kids that got away and dislikes this video ????
History is written by the victor.  Don't judge, without hearing both sides.
Where do gamers find all the accurate weapons
2:02 there, can you people stop bitching now?
Now we just need an Espionage mission in the concentration camp.And a soviet front mission
I’ve pre ordered it the beta was sick
Woah there sledgehammer, a swastika? Oh boy I can see a bunch of people screaming.
Of course, totally centred around the American effort in the war. Who joined 2 years late, and waited for Europe and particularly Britain to suffer, while the Russians nearly buckled under the German onslaught. Even if the game is set on solely the Western front, where are the British? Canadians? ANZACS? No where cause obviously the Americans did all the heavy lifting. People forget that the Royal Navy enabled D-day in its entirety, and that the Empire contributed the 2nd largest contingent of landing troops by a close margin to the Yanks. At least Battlefield 1 had the decency to show that all of Europe and America was embroiled in the global conflict that was Ww1.
Saving private Ryan did it better
looks like i finally like something about this game
Great trailer but the game won't be a quarter as good
Say what you will about Cod WW2 but this is DOPE
Supply drops ruined Call of Duty.
The campaign looks really good. However I can't shake this feeling about MP that just makes me not wanna play it, like it's just meh. Zombies should be good too. I can't justify $60 if I'm not gonna play MP so I gotta wait for a sale 😪
A 2 minute video proves nothing. Cutscenes don't prove anything. Games are about GAMEPLAY.
1:50 did this actually happen in my life time???? we are there I believe. I can't tell whats real and whats not anymore
Good. There's swastikas in the game.
One Good thing that we learn from this video\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThey finally put the real swastikas
The campaign better give me these same.chills if not.I'm suing the whole universe
why does my man have a tommy gun? huh that explains the snow, didn't know this game was set in Chicago...
Chinese war sword soliders theme is your last chance to competition BF1.
I never watched game graphic like this !! ''O'
Yes I love playing as Americans in every videogame I play
usually I say bf1 wins but when it comes to story mode cod wins every single time
Why does the m1 Garand sound like a laser 😂
I watch it over and over and over again
AH YES THE SIX MILLIONS OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLES WERE KILLED IGNORE OTHER COUNTRES SCHLOMO HEHEHE
I see a old character from advanced warfare the general. So lame and weak
Will they include the battle for ittler castle cuz it would be awesome since German and American fought together to defend the castle from the ss soldier
0:55 Well, hello Tom Hanks!
I cant see the videoD:
call of duty homecoming
Unlikers are Squad players.
this reminds me of Unbroken
Big red 1
nice work..
sweet
1:9 Jake Gyllenhaal from behind!!
What a swastika 0_0
Omoha beach?
Ah, I saw that cheeky preorder bonus.
2:04 when i saw 2:02
DAMN
swastikas are back boi !!!!
2:02 *HAPPY?*
Jonathan Tucker from kingdom
2:02 swastikas is back!
Very impressive!
FINALLY, SWASTIKA!!!
Like saving private ryan again.
1:50 false advertising smh
Something something swastikas something something women something something hype something
0.57 its josh duhamel voice?
Weird didn't know they were making another battlefield.
Probably best Cod trailer EVER!!! I fell like this game is going to be amazing!
AMAZING, i can learn history much better now.. Just like in the movie and i'm sure soon they'll make Call of Duty : THE PACIFIC..  i guaranteed it, can't wait for it!
So we're going back to the old classic style cod huh? Well a lot of people complained about the futuristic stuff they added especially in multiplayer. I guess this will satisfy them. Me personally I'm ok with both styles. What do you guys think?
Disappointed with this game! \nThis doesn't mention Russians fighting for Europe
I better be able to kill Hitler
nice game but my computer can't handle this (can't reach req)
Okay guys you finally got your damn Swastikas, Now can we shut up and enjoy the game or are we going to complain about some trivial thing next?
Reminds me of Big Red One a little bit
It looks like they spent their three years making this trailer instead of the actual game itself
Much better than the multi for sure
Why american soldier hide his dogtag when captured and being POW by german army?
It would be cool if they have a cameo with the squad from Cod 2 Big Red One, still remember Brooklyn's death
Bad. Your ideas get lost...
The graphics it's just beautiful
YOU HAVE EARNED MY SUBSCRIPTION
Where's my boy Tank Dempsey?\n\n\n\nit's a joke
Too bad the in game graphics won't be nearly as good as this😂😂
Finally! See Activision, this is all we wanted!
Wow looks amazing!! Hope there's a D-Day mission
I'm so happy has this is amazing
It has come full circle now
I can't wait to play it.  Looks good.
Are they gonna hire Matt Damon for this mov-- I mean game?
My cousin Mike helped build this game, he said they used mostly copper wire and tape for the graphics. Can't wait to see it play out.
This is going to be good
These are men, OUR MEN! When did you forget?
This is the call of duty that we need. It brings back the memories of the game that people will enjoy to play
Since they're arm most likely banned from using the SS lightning bolts as a symbol in this game, but they were still able to find a way to show the guy at 1:10 is SS. Being interested in history, specifically WW2 you can see that an eagle on the left arm was part of the SS uniform asides from the lightning bolts.
*pause at ****2:02* im buying this game now
There is no such thing as a good call of duty campaign.
BUT WILL THESE GRAPHICS BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE GAMEPLAY!?! :/
Sledgehammer please do not mess this up
Meine Ehre heißt Treue,Only a handful of the people in this comment section will unterstand the significance of this phrase. This game looks amazing congrats to Sledgehammer I think they're going to hit the spot of what is a great Call of Duty, but unfortunately I believe this generation who have been force-fed since their earliest years a narrow one sided view of this war will never truly understand what this war was like for the Germans or even the Axis countries in general, and the everlasting effect it has had on its people. As they say History is written by the victors... Just my 2 cents
The community will find a way to complain, don't worry.
World at war has been my favorite campaign lets seen if this can beat it
Looking forward to the campaign
2:02 THE SWASTICAS ARE BACK
Only thing cod is good at the story
Ready For World War 2!
Why does that German at 1:13 look like thefatrat's face?
Okay, they added Swastikas. For all the people who were complaining that there are none, you can shut up now.
Walther P38 instead of Luger P08 but never mind...
It looks like a movie my gawd
Dont give a damn about multiplayer, this is what I wanted
Bad thing is the actual game won’t look like this
0:29 That is Kingpin from Advanced warfare campaign.
is this a gamo or a fuckung movie lol no hate i like it so buy WWII
I sense a Battle of the Bulge scenario.
This looks so good but I hope they put time in other modes as well unlike infinity ward with infinite warfare
Better have the intervention in this one
I thought there weren't gonna be swastikas?
Looks like a live action movie
Well this is what we waited for.
I would love it if their story is gonna work like a single story in battlefield 1, like where there isnt constant fighting and theres parts where you have to move slow and be quiet and they don't hold your hand through it like they have done so much recently
.......this is the future of gaming......
More American crap, you guys realise the war started before 1941...
Infinite warfare is still better
Looks good, just kinda wish you could play as the good guys.
1:00 we thought we knew what war would be like... but nothing prepared us for this Actvision's reaction to historical inaccuracy hate
This looks like a movie!
How come every cod trailer that comes out i always end up watching it over and over
Is this a game or a movie, I can't tell
dday for the first time in 12 years...
Please keep in mind these arent ingame graphics. This is a cinematic short, these are typically always much more fleshed out. The game itself isn't anything special.
Americans didn’t do everything \nIt was the Soviets
If you look at 2:01\nYou know we're getting a hell of a good campaign
who else is looking forward for this game to drop or is it just me
1:59 now that's just badass.
I hope we get to see Adolf Hitler in this
SWASTIKAS! 2:02
Same old
Good Good
This looks really good
What story?
Swastikas confirmed
This looks dope as hell
Looks awesome
2:01 pause waw , feel like watching BoB ....
I STILL CANT BELIVE ITS NOT BUTTER
Soviet history?
Hi

Graphics are amazing
Finally caught on
Saving Private Ryan: The Game
2:06 RIP BATTLEFIELD 1
Love how every German looks horribly evil and not normal men and boys trying to survive
Why did they do this instead of the pacific front or at least the African front I'm not saying this is bad oh no just the western front is over used.
Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
on my console it dont work :(
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
I can’t get it to work. Help?
I'm tearing up right here, legit
WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy

岩田「直接！」\n(iwata) (Choku setsu !)
Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
It doesnt work
Faked for views
Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.
This isn't working for me...
i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
I'm not a fan of mute videos.
did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.
Someone buy this buy a better camera.
Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;

So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄

i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.

I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer

Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.

That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')

I just got a switch and cant get it to launch...brand new but it wont launch
Wow, how did this pass 7/11/2017?
I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer
Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.
Are you supposed to press any of the top shoulder buttons when you do this?
This video was made on my friends birthday
Holy moly can you speak or not?
on my console it dont work :(
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
fake

He's so humble & cute. I'm glad he's proud of his childhood acting. Most child stars are so bitter.
He looks almost EXACTLY THE SAME! Oh my god!
Omg he seems SO genuine and nice!
I thought Malcolm would run for president now
The song and his personality came together very beautifully. He was very humble and the whole thing was very touching.  His musicality was excellent and his frame and posture were vey good, they kept body contact during the whole dance. However,  there were no heel leads, When he stepped back he didn't glide on the floor, there was almost no sway and his arms were really stiff. It was a beautiful, lyrical, touching foxtrot but technically it was weak. a 6 from me.
I enjoyed this performance.
I freaking love Frankie! \nYou know some people are like, 'Don't call me Carlton..' 😂😂😂😂😂
Frankie Muniz is the man! I hope he wins he's always been a cool guy and never let the fame go to his head
I want him to win.
i see a male contender 👏👌
 you know call me Malcolm I'll probably respond  😂😂😂
It's cute seeing him so shy 😂
Whitney is 23, Frankie is 31... seriously doubt her dad is same age!   LOL        LOVE Frankie!!!!!!    So humble!
Frankie looks amazing!
Whitney got ass
where's reese
Life is unfair!
He's good!
That was beautiful I love him
0:37 malcom still breaking the 4th wall after all these years. XD
Wow all they gave was a 6 shit they cheap i think he did atleast a 23
He is so handsome
He is just the most adorable thing lol he seems super cool to be around which is awesome to know that someone from one of my favorite shows is super cool haha
Cody Banks...ok.
I loved Frankie when I was younger he was always my fav actor to watch now I'm 16 about to be 17 in a month and I still remember him as my first crush and he danced to Harry's song now I'm honestly going to die a happy girl😂❤️
Loooooved this dance!!!  What a surprise! Loved it ❤️
What nonsense that score they gave him was trash!!! He should have gotten more than that😡😡
I ship them!!❤
What's the name of the song they are dancing to? Thanks!
Agent Cody Banks, Lizzie McGuire guest appearance and Big Fat Liar. Always on an adventure it seems.
i do like his humility, I like his sincerity, not pompous at all :)
Awww so cute, love him
I thought frankie was dead?
Frankie bears a strong resemblance to joe montana.just add some curly locks.
He seems like a nice relate-able guy. Hope he does well!
Did he stumble at 1:48? It looked like they tripped over each other's feet
I was watching others performances to see if they were going to use any of Harrys song and I literally screamed when SOTT came on. \n\np.s. I also watched the other performances to rate them not just because of Harry
He could be good, but I think he needs to widen his arms movment and slow them down, to make the movment look more gracious...
He is so sweet omg.
I love him 💟Frankie
What a sweet, humble guy - I wasn't expecting him to be like that. I hope he grows through this and does really well.
he's so cute!!  been a huge fan of his for years, so they got my votes.
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
How the hell is Frankie old enough to be her dad?\nOr was she just kidding?\nB/c, like, he's 31, which is younger than my parents were when I was born.
He's good! I'll vote for him
Frankie Muniz is always been one of my favorite actors. I was really sad that he retired so early. I'm very glad to see his return
Malcom in the middle class.
also in what world is 480p hd
Malcome ....awkward......
bitch has a thicc ass damnn
Friend zone Frankie
Also Frankie did so good
IS FRANKIE MUNIZ SANE AGAIN OR??
I feel like michael bay directed this
there i was ... hoping for a wehrmacht campain.
Still a few butthurt nerds over CoD WWII still having women and poc in the game because it's not historically accurate. So if you do some research, you'll find that in other countries, women served in combat, as well as poc in the U.S. They were separated but, still saw combat.
When they will finally do a new story line at the Eastern front, Norther region, Italy, Balkans, Egypt, Philippines and something involving other nations? It's called World War II for a reason, not American Hero Campaign 23!
Hey! That's pretty good!
Can someone give a name of the soundtrack?
Oy vey, this will be good!
I saw swastikas like if u saw them
no more wall jumping robots i'm happy yeeaahh i got motion sick on blops 3
How do people not know the difference between in game graphics and pre rendered cinematics at this point...
When graphics are better than real life
1:38 - 1:39\n\nDid you notice? When he hit him with the machine gun, he did not even touch him!
Daym... the graphics and the campaign is too nasty😍
2:01 this is what i like to see!
Best game war ever. T
I have a feeling that cod ww2 is gonna have a great and emotional campaign (probably) just like the one in cod waw
Shut up and take my money! ... Oh wait, they already did... Shut up and give me that game! :D
2017, cod retards are still falling for CGI xDDDDDDDDDDDDD Idiots, that's not CoD WW2 graphic, THESE ARE JUST CUTSCENES. Cod graphic will be 100 times worse like always.
Looks like the zombies and campaign will be better than the actual multiplayer
This Is What I've Been Waiting For!! So Hyped ❤️
tbh Bf1 campaign is so dull and too fast, i hope Cod Ww2 bring something new to me, my last cod is Aw
Get ready for grenade spam on veteran :)
no soviet union in CoD about WW2, gg
Game looks amazing a cod in recent years that I am Excited for.
You can win everyone \nPeople moan if it's future bullshit or they moan if it's in the past \nMake your Bloody mind up\nNo wonder Activision can't decide straight away what game to make as you half of the people wanting the opposite thing
this looks cool, but knowing call of duty, it's gonna be about 6 short and repetitive missions long
This better be good!
So we're not gonna be fighting Japan in this game?
I can't wait that game
Greece fought 2 its a shame that we didnt get even an honourable mention ;(
THIS looks like real life game
I SEE A SWASTIKA
i like m1 garand sound at the end
Wasn't expecting that, good job.
So psyched. Finally I can return to COD after years of considering the series a joke
Thats the cod been looking for .....
Wait for someone to get offended that there is no black soldiers...
man too bad new games costs so much I'd get this for the campaign, might play multiplayer a bit but mostly for the campaign
That's more like it. Now just get rid of microtransactions, quickscoping snipers, and pre-teen  squeakers in the multiplayer, and we have a winner.
Im more excited to play the campaign than multiplayer
Bf1 will be always better
Reminds me a lot of Band of Brothers.
this the real cod and not the future shits like last 3
trailer be like Christopher Nolan and the game be like Michael bay.
When will the time travellers come in and give the US the exo suits
Should be a movie
I thought this video has age limitation, but why theres still some kids that got away and dislikes this video ????
History is written by the victor.  Don't judge, without hearing both sides.
Where do gamers find all the accurate weapons
2:02 there, can you people stop bitching now?
Now we just need an Espionage mission in the concentration camp.And a soviet front mission
I’ve pre ordered it the beta was sick
Woah there sledgehammer, a swastika? Oh boy I can see a bunch of people screaming.
Of course, totally centred around the American effort in the war. Who joined 2 years late, and waited for Europe and particularly Britain to suffer, while the Russians nearly buckled under the German onslaught. Even if the game is set on solely the Western front, where are the British? Canadians? ANZACS? No where cause obviously the Americans did all the heavy lifting. People forget that the Royal Navy enabled D-day in its entirety, and that the Empire contributed the 2nd largest contingent of landing troops by a close margin to the Yanks. At least Battlefield 1 had the decency to show that all of Europe and America was embroiled in the global conflict that was Ww1.
Saving private Ryan did it better
looks like i finally like something about this game
Great trailer but the game won't be a quarter as good
Say what you will about Cod WW2 but this is DOPE
Supply drops ruined Call of Duty.
The campaign looks really good. However I can't shake this feeling about MP that just makes me not wanna play it, like it's just meh. Zombies should be good too. I can't justify $60 if I'm not gonna play MP so I gotta wait for a sale 😪
A 2 minute video proves nothing. Cutscenes don't prove anything. Games are about GAMEPLAY.
1:50 did this actually happen in my life time???? we are there I believe. I can't tell whats real and whats not anymore
Good. There's swastikas in the game.
One Good thing that we learn from this video\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThey finally put the real swastikas
The campaign better give me these same.chills if not.I'm suing the whole universe
why does my man have a tommy gun? huh that explains the snow, didn't know this game was set in Chicago...
Chinese war sword soliders theme is your last chance to competition BF1.
I never watched game graphic like this !! ''O'
Yes I love playing as Americans in every videogame I play
usually I say bf1 wins but when it comes to story mode cod wins every single time
Why does the m1 Garand sound like a laser 😂
I watch it over and over and over again
AH YES THE SIX MILLIONS OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLES WERE KILLED IGNORE OTHER COUNTRES SCHLOMO HEHEHE
I see a old character from advanced warfare the general. So lame and weak
Will they include the battle for ittler castle cuz it would be awesome since German and American fought together to defend the castle from the ss soldier
0:55 Well, hello Tom Hanks!
I cant see the videoD:
call of duty homecoming
Unlikers are Squad players.
this reminds me of Unbroken
Big red 1
nice work..
sweet
1:9 Jake Gyllenhaal from behind!!
What a swastika 0_0
Omoha beach?
Ah, I saw that cheeky preorder bonus.
2:04 when i saw 2:02
DAMN
swastikas are back boi !!!!
2:02 *HAPPY?*
Jonathan Tucker from kingdom
2:02 swastikas is back!
Very impressive!
FINALLY, SWASTIKA!!!
Like saving private ryan again.
1:50 false advertising smh
Something something swastikas something something women something something hype something
0.57 its josh duhamel voice?
Weird didn't know they were making another battlefield.
Probably best Cod trailer EVER!!! I fell like this game is going to be amazing!
AMAZING, i can learn history much better now.. Just like in the movie and i'm sure soon they'll make Call of Duty : THE PACIFIC..  i guaranteed it, can't wait for it!
So we're going back to the old classic style cod huh? Well a lot of people complained about the futuristic stuff they added especially in multiplayer. I guess this will satisfy them. Me personally I'm ok with both styles. What do you guys think?
Disappointed with this game! \nThis doesn't mention Russians fighting for Europe
I better be able to kill Hitler
nice game but my computer can't handle this (can't reach req)
Okay guys you finally got your damn Swastikas, Now can we shut up and enjoy the game or are we going to complain about some trivial thing next?
Reminds me of Big Red One a little bit
It looks like they spent their three years making this trailer instead of the actual game itself
Much better than the multi for sure
Why american soldier hide his dogtag when captured and being POW by german army?
It would be cool if they have a cameo with the squad from Cod 2 Big Red One, still remember Brooklyn's death
Bad. Your ideas get lost...
The graphics it's just beautiful
YOU HAVE EARNED MY SUBSCRIPTION
Where's my boy Tank Dempsey?\n\n\n\nit's a joke
Too bad the in game graphics won't be nearly as good as this😂😂
Finally! See Activision, this is all we wanted!
Wow looks amazing!! Hope there's a D-Day mission
I'm so happy has this is amazing
It has come full circle now
I can't wait to play it.  Looks good.
Are they gonna hire Matt Damon for this mov-- I mean game?
My cousin Mike helped build this game, he said they used mostly copper wire and tape for the graphics. Can't wait to see it play out.
This is going to be good
These are men, OUR MEN! When did you forget?
This is the call of duty that we need. It brings back the memories of the game that people will enjoy to play
Since they're arm most likely banned from using the SS lightning bolts as a symbol in this game, but they were still able to find a way to show the guy at 1:10 is SS. Being interested in history, specifically WW2 you can see that an eagle on the left arm was part of the SS uniform asides from the lightning bolts.
*pause at ****2:02* im buying this game now
There is no such thing as a good call of duty campaign.
BUT WILL THESE GRAPHICS BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE GAMEPLAY!?! :/
Sledgehammer please do not mess this up
Meine Ehre heißt Treue,Only a handful of the people in this comment section will unterstand the significance of this phrase. This game looks amazing congrats to Sledgehammer I think they're going to hit the spot of what is a great Call of Duty, but unfortunately I believe this generation who have been force-fed since their earliest years a narrow one sided view of this war will never truly understand what this war was like for the Germans or even the Axis countries in general, and the everlasting effect it has had on its people. As they say History is written by the victors... Just my 2 cents
The community will find a way to complain, don't worry.
World at war has been my favorite campaign lets seen if this can beat it
Looking forward to the campaign
2:02 THE SWASTICAS ARE BACK
Only thing cod is good at the story
Ready For World War 2!
Why does that German at 1:13 look like thefatrat's face?
Okay, they added Swastikas. For all the people who were complaining that there are none, you can shut up now.
Walther P38 instead of Luger P08 but never mind...
It looks like a movie my gawd
Dont give a damn about multiplayer, this is what I wanted
Bad thing is the actual game won’t look like this
0:29 That is Kingpin from Advanced warfare campaign.
is this a gamo or a fuckung movie lol no hate i like it so buy WWII
I sense a Battle of the Bulge scenario.
This looks so good but I hope they put time in other modes as well unlike infinity ward with infinite warfare
Better have the intervention in this one
I thought there weren't gonna be swastikas?
Looks like a live action movie
Well this is what we waited for.
I would love it if their story is gonna work like a single story in battlefield 1, like where there isnt constant fighting and theres parts where you have to move slow and be quiet and they don't hold your hand through it like they have done so much recently
.......this is the future of gaming......
More American crap, you guys realise the war started before 1941...
Infinite warfare is still better
Looks good, just kinda wish you could play as the good guys.
1:00 we thought we knew what war would be like... but nothing prepared us for this Actvision's reaction to historical inaccuracy hate
This looks like a movie!
How come every cod trailer that comes out i always end up watching it over and over
Is this a game or a movie, I can't tell
dday for the first time in 12 years...
Please keep in mind these arent ingame graphics. This is a cinematic short, these are typically always much more fleshed out. The game itself isn't anything special.
Americans didn’t do everything \nIt was the Soviets
If you look at 2:01\nYou know we're getting a hell of a good campaign
who else is looking forward for this game to drop or is it just me
1:59 now that's just badass.
I hope we get to see Adolf Hitler in this
SWASTIKAS! 2:02
Same old
Good Good
This looks really good
What story?
Swastikas confirmed
This looks dope as hell
Looks awesome
2:01 pause waw , feel like watching BoB ....
I STILL CANT BELIVE ITS NOT BUTTER
Soviet history?
Hi
FINALLY THEY LISTENED
Another hyped up preview
TIIIIIIGGEEERRR TAAAAAAAANNK!!!
I just had siezur
aka bf 1
Nope
1980
Looks really good
finally... we have SWASTIKAS
SWASTIKAS! YES!
#RIPBF1
It lit
Bungie plus Activision equals golden COD egg 😂😂
Graphics are amazing
Finally caught on
Saving Private Ryan: The Game
2:06 RIP BATTLEFIELD 1
Love how every German looks horribly evil and not normal men and boys trying to survive
Why did they do this instead of the pacific front or at least the African front I'm not saying this is bad oh no just the western front is over used.
Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
on my console it dont work :(
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
I can’t get it to work. Help?
I'm tearing up right here, legit
WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy

This is fucking beautiful.

I really gotta learn sign language.
岩田「直接！」\n(iwata) (Choku setsu !)
Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
It doesnt work
Faked for views
Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.
This isn't working for me...
i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
I'm not a fan of mute videos.
did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.
Someone buy this buy a better camera.

Goat fire brigade'  helps save Spain from forest fires\nhttps://youtu.be/ImFJAw2SnZg
I understood how the 3ds had all types of hidden games, but why would Nintendo make you summon a game?
Holy moly can you speak or not?
Cool video paying your respects to him. 👍
i used to rock this game on my nes
Hey that's some pretty good asmr
thank you for posting this.
I did the exact same thing and yet i didnt get it
May I put forward a proposition; you shout me out, and I reciprocate (Do the same)
check.  out.    watch.     now.   \nshared.    my.      video.    2017.
Oh man, I remember that game.
I don't say this often for actions made by people, but this is beautiful...
This is on trending
So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.

Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
i'm not crying
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.

I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
You get a B+ as a mime.
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
For you
Stupid .  Why you no narrate

Directly.
Stuff that should be trending
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
I can’t get it to work. Help?
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
donget it, you just wave your hands around and the game starts?
I just want to know how long and how many hand movement combos it took for him to find the easter egg lol...he has to know a designer
does this work for july 11 2018?
is it possible to do this without hacking your switch?
Oh yeah reaaaall cool guy,  😑
fake
on my console it dont work :(
Get a pc
How did someone figure all of this out?
i cant get it to work XP
This isn't working for me...
I just got a switch and cant get it to launch...brand new but it wont launch
Wow, how did this pass 7/11/2017?
Unfortunately wont work for me. Been at it for 15 minutes with 2 different sets of joy-cons doing my best interpretation of the gesture (and of course date set to 7/11) but no luck.
Are you supposed to press any of the top shoulder buttons when you do this?
Iwata almost ran Nintendo into the fucking ground
Faked for views
Due to the overwhelming response to this video, I felt it appropriate to give an explanation.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkAvnnFICE&feature=youtu.be
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
*Summoning Iwata's ghost intensifies*
I really gotta learn sign language.
Bru I’m pretty amazed that you did all that backwards honestly
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
That's pretty creepy the way this is hidden inside without Nintendo saying anything about and the way you have to do Iwata's directly to you hand sign,  now now I'm staring at my switch all weird while playing Splatoon 2 LOL.
He died on my birthday.
I can't get it to woek
This legit makes me want to cry.
We miss you Iwata-san TT.TT\nMad respect for Nintendo for that easter egg!
Nar this doesn't work..
You know, I never believed my friend when he said an NES game showed up when he was moving around his Joy-Cons a while back. Interesting to know it was Golf.
This is such a thoughtful tribute ...that is makes me want to cry! :')
How the fuck did you figure that out??

I understood how the 3ds had all types of hidden games, but why would Nintendo make you summon a game?
Cool video paying your respects to him. 👍
i used to rock this game on my nes
Hey that's some pretty good asmr
thank you for posting this.
I did the exact same thing and yet i didnt get it
May I put forward a proposition; you shout me out, and I reciprocate (Do the same)
UAU.. Best tribute easter egg ever time...
Clickbait.
Oh man, I remember that game.
This is on trending
i'm not crying
So lets keep count of the amount of viewers that don't even have a Nintendo but still watched the whole video. 😄
it doesnt work to me.. i make thise stupid moves with the joy con's since 10 min but it doesnt open the game
Nice to see Iwata's name trending on YouTube..
I just don't buy it. Can't get it to work and it's too damn cryptic.
I like that Nintendo makes family-oriented products, as compared to the other companies.
He is the OA

I need to connect to the monitor and demonstrate it
its not showing a thing there to allow me to change the system time and date
Do you get to keep the game, or is it only playable on July 11th?

As much as this is seems a tear jerker, its best to not open the program as it is a Omamori, per this twitter https://twitter.com/sprsk/status/910295200228032512?lang=en
I couldnt get it to work on my switch no matter how much I tried can anybody help me
